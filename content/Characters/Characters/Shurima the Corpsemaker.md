## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Moiloc follows Shurima into an alley where she finds a murdered priest. The next day, [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] questions him about a piece of paper he has, but he refuses to tell her what it is.

He is next seen in the sewers during the first Game the party attempts. He is shoving bodies into a sack. He promises to teleport the party out before the rats kill them if they give him their sigil. He also mentions that they need behelits to escape, saying that he has five. Branwyn steals the sigil from [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] and gives it to him, and he teleports them out of the sewers.
