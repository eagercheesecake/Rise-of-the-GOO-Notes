## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Lexar tries to get to the stage where the games would be announced, wanting to be in the front of the crowd. On his way, he mediates a fight between a banker and an old man who had just crashed into each other, suggesting a game, culminating in the banker knocking the old man out.

After seeing the announcement of the Games, Lexar goes to the inn to meet with [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], promising to meet up with him the next day after the rest of the rules are announced to discuss strategy. The next day, upon learning they must form teams, the pair team up, and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] asks to join as well. The group proceeds to the docks to begin looking for sigils.

The group meets [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] at the docks, who joins their team. They explore some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the sigil. Lexar refuses to give the seal up, saying they can take the rats. He asks Moiloc for the behelit she has after Shurima mentions needing a behelit to escape, saying he has five of his own. Lexar tries to covertly combine the power of the behelit with his own, but is unable to take on the rats. Branwyn steals the seal from him and gives it to Shurima, who teleports them back to the docks. Lexar tells Branwyn this was a well-played move on her part. Moiloc resorts to violence to make Lexar give her behelit back.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
