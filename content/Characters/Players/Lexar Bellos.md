## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Lexar tries to get to the stage where the games would be announced, wanting to be in the front of the crowd. On his way, he mediates a fight between a banker and an old man who had just crashed into each other, suggesting a game, culminating in the banker knocking the old man out.

After seeing the announcement of the Games, Lexar goes to the inn to meet with [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], promising to meet up with him the next day after the rest of the rules are announced to discuss strategy. The next day, upon learning they must form teams, the pair team up, and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] asks to join as well. The group proceeds to the docks to begin looking for sigils.

The group meets [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] at the docks, who joins their team. They explore some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the sigil. Lexar refuses to give the seal up, saying they can take the rats. He asks Moiloc for the behelit she has after Shurima mentions needing a behelit to escape, saying he has five of his own. Lexar tries to covertly combine the power of the behelit with his own, but is unable to take on the rats. Branwyn steals the seal from him and gives it to Shurima, who teleports them back to the docks. Lexar tells Branwyn this was a well-played move on her part. Moiloc resorts to violence to make Lexar give her behelit back.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
## [[Session 02 - The Party Gets Puzzled]]
Upon arriving to the arena, Gertrude tells everyone that she saw the arena yesterday, noting it was a large, manufactured forest. Lexar and Branwyn decide to try and sneak into the arena through the back to rescue the bears without having to join the melee. Lexar shows a guard his behelit, which scares the guard into letting them in, and he is able to use his behelit to open a door in the back of the arena. They go through a series of puzzles behind the door. At one point Branwyn is charmed by a bucket of water, and Lexar dunks her head into the bucket to break the trance, and in another room Lexar is downed in a test of common sense and Branwyn saves him. After the puzzles, they reach a room in the arena where they find a king's seal, and proceed to the stands of the arena.
## [[Session 03 - The Party Saves the Bears]]
Branwyn and Lexar watch the melee from the stands, getting lizards on a stick as a snack. Once the others win, they toss some lizards down to them in celebration. The group then returns to the inn for the night.
