## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Moiloc comes to Montrissad to join the games, and begins looking for lodgings. On her way, she notices an ominous wrinkled man, Shurima, in the crowd, and follows him. She loses him, but finds the corpse of a priest and a red behelit in an alley, and takes the behelit.

Moiloc arrives at the inn and agrees to work in the downstairs pub in exchange for a room. She leaves briefly to hear the announcement of the Games before returning for her shift. The next day, after the rules are announced, she overhears [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] and [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] forming a team, and asks to join it as well. She is accepted, and Lexar suggest they begin at the docks. Moiloc leads the way, getting lost.

The group meets [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] at the docks, who joins their team. They explore some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the sigil. Lexar refuses to give the seal up, saying they can take the rats. He asks Moiloc for the behelit she has, trying to covertly combine the power of the behelit with his own, but is unable to take on the rats. Branwyn steals the seal from him and gives it to Shurima, who teleports them back to the docks. Lexar tells Branwyn this was a well-played move on her part. Moiloc resorts to violence to make Lexar give her behelit back.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
## [[Session 02 - The Party Gets Puzzled]]
Moiloc tells the others that she is a princess from the Kodlak Islands. Upon arriving to the arena, Gertrude tells everyone that she saw the arena yesterday, noting it was a large, manufactured forest. Gertrude, Kaldrake, and Moiloc stay in line to sign up for the melee. While waiting, they try and decide on a team name, landing on Teddy and the Roosevelts.

Upon entering the arena, they see it has changed to a large area of water with a couple islands, one of which has a large tower. Moiloc remembers Shurima from the sewers, and begins praying to him for safety. Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Moiloc quickly take a boat, taking down some other players on the way. Gertrude steers the ship while Kaldrake and Moiloc man the ballista and take down an attacking ship. They approach the island with the tower.

## [[Session 03 - The Party Saves the Bears]]
The group takes down a couple other ships on their way to the island, and Gertrude sets the island on fire when they land. She finds druidic messages that point underground, and Gertrude has Moiloc dig in the designated spot, exposing a cave. Upon entering, they find a [[Pine|bear cub]] with a very injured mother. Gertrude saves the cub, and has Kaldrake put the mother out of her misery. Continuing down the cave, they find a ladder leading to the top of the tower.

At the top, the trio touches a flag which teleports them back to the entrance. They watch the tower crumble on the burning island, and see the last names disappear from the board listing the living players. The group is awarded with a king's seal for winning, and each person gets to take an item from the treasure room. Moiloc gets a magic golden sword with a lion's head on the hilt.

The group returns to the inn. Gertrude and the bear join Moiloc in her room for the night. Overnight, Moiloc sees Shurima in a dream. He sticks his finger in her eye until his hand is flush with her face. When she wakes up, she finds a ring with an eye on it, and in her head she hears Shurima tell her to follow the path of her heart to find what she seeks.
