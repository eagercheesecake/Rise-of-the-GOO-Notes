## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Moiloc comes to Montrissad to join the games, and begins looking for lodgings. On her way, she notices an ominous wrinkled man, Shurima, in the crowd, and follows him. She loses him, but finds the corpse of a priest and a red behelit in an alley, and takes the behelit.

Moiloc arrives at the inn and agrees to work in the downstairs pub in exchange for a room. She leaves briefly to hear the announcement of the Games before returning for her shift. The next day, after the rules are announced, she overhears [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] and [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] forming a team, and asks to join it as well. She is accepted, and Lexar suggest they begin at the docks. Moiloc leads the way, getting lost.

The group meets [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] at the docks, who joins their team. They explore some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the sigil. Lexar refuses to give the seal up, saying they can take the rats. He asks Moiloc for the behelit she has, trying to covertly combine the power of the behelit with his own, but is unable to take on the rats. Branwyn steals the seal from him and gives it to Shurima, who teleports them back to the docks. Lexar tells Branwyn this was a well-played move on her part. Moiloc resorts to violence to make Lexar give her behelit back.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
