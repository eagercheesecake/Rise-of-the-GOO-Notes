## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Kaldrake gets to the inn in Montrissad and reserves a room. After the announcement of the Games, he meets with [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] at the inn, since Gwyneth had sent Lexar a letter asking him to protect Kaldrake. They agree to cooperate, and when the rules are announced, quickly decide to form a team. Soon after, [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] asks to join the team as well, and is accepted. Lexar suggests the group begins by searching the docks, as he had noticed some knights there in the previous days.

The group meets [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] at the docks, who joins their team. They explore some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the seal, and upon complying, the group is teleported back to the docks.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
## [[Session 02 - The Party Gets Puzzled]]
Upon arriving to the arena, Gertrude tells everyone that she saw the arena yesterday, noting it was a large, manufactured forest. Gertrude, Kaldrake, and Moiloc stay in line to sign up for the melee. While waiting, they try and decide on a team name, landing on Teddy and the Roosevelts.

Upon entering the arena, they see it has changed to a large area of water with a couple islands, one of which has a large tower. Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Moiloc quickly take a boat, taking down some other players on the way. Gertrude steers the ship while Kaldrake and Moiloc man the ballista and take down an attacking ship. They approach the island with the tower.
## [[Session 03 - The Party Saves the Bears]]
The group takes down a couple other ships on their way to the island, and Gertrude sets the island on fire when they land. She finds druidic messages that point underground, and Gertrude has Moiloc dig in the designated spot, exposing a cave. Upon entering, they find a [[Pine|bear cub]] with a very injured mother. Gertrude saves the cub, and has Kaldrake put the mother out of her misery. Continuing down the cave, they find a ladder leading to the top of the tower.

At the top, the trio touches a flag which teleports them back to the entrance. They watch the tower crumble on the burning island, and see the last names disappear from the board listing the living players. The group is awarded with a king's seal for winning, and each person gets to take an item from the treasure room. Kaldrake gets Bracers of the Ogre, which increases his strength. The group returns to the inn for the night.
