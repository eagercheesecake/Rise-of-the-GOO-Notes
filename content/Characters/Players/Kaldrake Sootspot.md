## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Kaldrake gets to the inn in Montrissad and reserves a room. After the announcement of the Games, he meets with [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] at the inn, since Gwyneth had sent Lexar a letter asking him to protect Kaldrake. They agree to cooperate, and when the rules are announced, quickly decide to form a team. Soon after, [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] asks to join the team as well, and is accepted. Lexar suggests the group begins by searching the docks, as he had noticed some knights there in the previous days.

The group meets [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] at the docks, who joins their team. They explore some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the seal, and upon complying, the group is teleported back to the docks.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
