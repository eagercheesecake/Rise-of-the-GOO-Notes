### [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Branwyn finds [[Monty's Son]] on the streets of Montrissad, who points her to Monty to sell her cloak. On her way to Monty's, she is attacked by a teenage thief, and knocks him out, leaving him some gold as an apology. Monty tries to rip her off in the sale, but fails, and instead offers to sponsor her in the Games. Branwyn shows the letter to [[Jim MacMasters]] at the inn and gets a room.

The next day, Branwyn returns to Monty and accepts his proposition. He tells her to call him if she needs anything. She returns to the inn and asks Jim where [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] was, remembering her from the night before as a possible candidate for a teammate. He tells her she went to the docks, and she proceeds there, meeting up with Moiloc, [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], and [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], asking to join their team.

The group explores some nearby fog and eventually find a crate being guarded by knights. Upon entering, they are teleported to the sewers, where they immediately find a king's seal. After proceeding through the sewers looking for an escape, they are attacked by rats, ending up in a room where [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] is seen shoving bodies into a bag. He promises to let them out in exchange for the sigil. Lexar refuses to give the seal up, saying they can take the rats, so Branwyn steals it from him and gives it to Shurima, who teleports them back to the docks. Lexar tells Branwyn this was a well-played move on her part.

They return to the inn, where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears them lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
