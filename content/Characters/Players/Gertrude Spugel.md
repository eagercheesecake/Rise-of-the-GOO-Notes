## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Gertrude comes to Montrissad to buy treats for her bears. In the treat shop, she meets [[Jacob]], who is working at the shop. He tells her [[King Aslan]] took all the treats for the Games. They both express frustration toward the king, and Gertrude convinces Jacob to join the Games and make something of himself.

Gertrude proceeds to the inn to find a room, and questions some knights as to why the King bought out all the bear treats, guilting them with her age and blackmailing them. She learns the bears are being used in the melee. She decides with a coin flip to stay in Montrissad and save them. She goes to see the announcement of the Games, however, unable to afford a room at the inn, spends the night in the stables.

The next day, Gertrude proceeds to the stables, trying to get in to save the bears. On her way, she sees [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] in the streets and asks him what the piece of paper he is holding is, but he won't tell her. She arrives at the arena. After trying to enter from the audience stands, attempting to sneak in while people are distracted by [[Gwyneth Sootspot|a wizard]]'s pyrotechnics show, and threatening to piss herself, she realizes she isn't getting into the arena, and returns to the inn.

[[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
