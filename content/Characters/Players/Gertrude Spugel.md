## [[Session 01 - The Party Fights Sewer Rats]]
Gertrude comes to Montrissad to buy treats for her bears. In the treat shop, she meets [[Jacob]], who is working at the shop. He tells her [[King Aslan]] took all the treats for the Games. They both express frustration toward the king, and Gertrude convinces Jacob to join the Games and make something of himself.

Gertrude proceeds to the inn to find a room, and questions some knights as to why the King bought out all the bear treats, guilting them with her age and blackmailing them. She learns the bears are being used in the melee. She decides with a coin flip to stay in Montrissad and save them. She goes to see the announcement of the Games, however, unable to afford a room at the inn, spends the night in the stables.

The next day, Gertrude proceeds to the stables, trying to get in to save the bears. On her way, she sees [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] in the streets and asks him what the piece of paper he is holding is, but he won't tell her. She arrives at the arena. After trying to enter from the audience stands, attempting to sneak in while people are distracted by [[Gwyneth Sootspot|a wizard]]'s pyrotechnics show, and threatening to piss herself, she realizes she isn't getting into the arena, and returns to the inn.

[[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] overhears [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] lamenting about their failed Game. She asks to join them upon the condition that they help her save the bears.
## [[Session 02 - The Party Gets Puzzled]]
Upon arriving to the arena, Gertrude tells everyone that she saw the arena yesterday, noting it was a large, manufactured forest. Gertrude stays in line with Kaldrake and Moiloc to sign up for the melee. While waiting, they try and decide on a team name, landing on Teddy and the Roosevelts.

Upon entering the arena, they see it has changed to a large area of water with a couple islands, one of which has a large tower. Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Moiloc quickly take a boat, taking down some other players on the way. Gertrude steers the ship while Kaldrake and Moiloc man the ballista and take down an attacking ship. They approach the island with the tower.
## [[Session 03 - The Party Saves the Bears]]
The group takes down a couple other ships on their way to the island, and Gertrude sets the island on fire when they land. She finds druidic messages that point underground, and Gertrude has Moiloc dig in the designated spot, exposing a cave. Upon entering, they find a [[Pine|bear cub]] with a very injured mother. Gertrude saves the cub, and has Kaldrake put the mother out of her misery. Continuing down the cave, they find a ladder leading to the top of the tower.

At the top, the trio touches a flag which teleports them back to the entrance. They watch the tower crumble on the burning island, and see the last names disappear from the board listing the living players, including Jacob's name. Gertrude mourns Lexar and Branwyn before seeing them cheering her on from the stands. The group is awarded with a king's seal for winning, and each person gets to take an item from the treasure room. Gertrude gets Glasses of the Eagle, which increases her sight. The group returns to the inn, and Gertrude and the bear, which she names Pine, sleep in Moiloc's room.
