### Logline
*Lexar and Branwyn find themselves in a mysterious puzzle dungeon. Gertrude, Moiloc, and Kaldrake enter the Grand Melee in an attempt to save the bears.*
### Synopsis
The group go to the arena to save Gertrude's bears, per her ultimatum. Lexar and Branwyn try to sneak in through the guard entrance, and the others stay in the sign-up line in case they are unsuccessful. Branwyn and Lexar distract the guards and are able to enter through the back entrance, where after a long hallway Lexar unlocks a door with his behelit, leading him and Branwyn to a dungeon full of various puzzles. Once completing them, the pair is rewarded with a king's seal. Meanwhile, Gertrude, Moiloc, and Kaldrake decide on a team name and enter the Melee. They set sail on provided boats in an attempt to escape the bloodbath at the docks, and manage to take down a couple other ships as well.
# Day 3 

## Montrissad Streets
After reuniting the next morning at the inn, the group make their way to the arena. Having experience with the arena, [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] leads the way, although slowly due to her age. On the walk, [[Moiloc Kodlaksdottër|Moiloc]] reveals more about her past, and the past of the Kodlak Islands. 
## The Arena 
The group gets in line for the arena sign-in while Gertrude debriefs the others on what she saw at the arena the day before. She notes that the arena is a manufactured forest, and tells of the guard entrance at the back. The team discusses tactics, and suggest that someone goes and checks out the guard entrance and see if they can sneak in, while the others stay in line for registration. [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] and [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] volunteer to go to the guard entrance, and the others stay in line.

The guard at the back seems to have been there for a while, and looks pretty tired and distractable. Lexar goes to speak with him, and Branwyn uses the opportunity to sneak in while the guard is distracted by the conversation. Once Branwyn enters, Lexar shows the guard his behelit, which seems to scare the guard, who lets Lexar proceed. This entrance leads to a long hallway, longer than Branwyn and Lexar can see with their dark vision. The hall seems to reach a dead end. Lexar notices a small hole in the door, and after telling Branwyn to watch his back, inserts the behelit into the hole, and the wall opens to reveal a chapel-like room with two doors at the end of the room. The behelit is shot out of the hole to allow the wall to open, but Lexar is able to catch it. Lexar seems to recognize the chapel, but all Branwyn is able to realize by his reaction is that he is surprised the chapel is in this location. The doors at the end of the hallway, one to the left and one to the right, each lead to a staircase which descends down. When one door is opened, the other closes. The pair decide to take the left staircase. 
## Puzzle Dungeon
This leads to a room with a trap wire which Branwyn notices. However, immediately after the wire is a pressure plate tile, which Branwyn steps on. Noticing the click, she stops before releasing her weight off the plate and triggering the trap. She attempts to use one of her hand axes to weigh down the plate, but the weight is not enough to keep the plate down, and she is shot with a crossbow bolt to the ankle. Lexar notices many pressured tiles, but also notices a path of tiles which appear to not be raised, and leads the way down the path closer to the exit on the other side of the room. The path ends a few tiles away from the exit, but Branwyn shoots some of the tiles, pressing them and making it safe to pass. 

Continuing to the next room, Lexar and Branwyn are met with a lit table with a piece of paper on it reading "DINNER" and a quill and ink jar. There are four skeletons on the ground. Confused on how to proceed, Lexar writes "I'm hungry, what's for" before "DINNER" on the paper. After nothing happens, he adds "Please" to the end of it, then by fingerpainting "DINNER" on the exit door with the ink. Still nothing happening, Branwyn examines the skeletons, noticing that each one has one rib which is marked ("DINNER" was supposed to lead them to the stomach's skeletons, but they didn't realize this). One rib reads "1", one reads "2", one is two parallel lines, and one is two perpendicular lines. After some maneuvering and struggling, Lexar writes "3" on the back of the "DINNER" paper, and aligns the bones and paper to read "1 + 2 = 3," after which the door opens. 

The next room has a fire in the center, with three statues. One has one stripe on their arm, one has two, and one has three. Lexar opens door one, then door two, then door three, finally leaving through the third door, thinking of following the "1, 2, 3" pattern in the previous room. The solution was to just leave through the third door. Lexar overcomplicated it. 
## Arena
Back in the line to registration, the others are attempting to decide what they are going to call themselves as a team on the registration form. Bear Squad is initially mentioned, but [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] feared it would make it too obvious that they released the bears if they were to succeed in that feat. Looking for another animal to represent their team, Moiloc suggests Lion Squad, although the others worried this might be lion appropriation and upset the king. Panther was also suggested, but the team really started getting somewhere once Hatched Pig Players was suggested. Liking the alliteration, Patched Pig Players is suggested, but the alliteration of Ps was too reminiscent of urine, which Gertrude wanted to distance herself from after the "piss grandma" fiasco. Liking the alliteration and name despite this unfortunate shorthand, they decided Latched Lig Layers might be better. Slashed Slig Slayers sounded cooler, so it was agreed upon by Kaldrake and Gertrude, but Moiloc liked Latched Lig Layers better and attempted to sneakily write that on the registration form again. Gertrude notices and tells her to correct it. Moiloc does so, poorly, making the line near illegible. 

Kaldrake, realizing there are still mixed opinions on the name, suggests the group return to the back of the line and talk it through again, which the others agree with. Gertrude, still liking attributing the name of the team to bears as a theme, suggests the others pick a number from 1 to 50, each number representing one of her personal bears, ranked from favorite to least favorite. Moiloc and Kaldrake both immediately go with 50, the least favorite bear, Teddy Roosevelt, leading to the final decision on the team name: "Teddy and the Roosevelts." 
## Puzzle Dungeon
The next room filled Lexar and Branwyn with a sense of calm. At the end of the room is four water basins, each magically glowing. Branwyn looks into the first one, and becomes entranced by the water, unable to do anything but stare into it and see dream-like visions. Lexar covers the basin with his cloak, but she remained entranced. Lexar keeps trying to push her over, but on the fifth attempt falls over himself. Upset, he pushes Branwyn's head into the water, breaking the surface of the water and also breaking the trance, allowing the doors to open. 
## Arena
Gertrude, Kaldrake, and Moiloc finally register, and enter, as two hours had passed, the melee was about to begin, and there was still no sign of Lexar or Branwyn. Gertrude notices a huge orc in heavy armor with a warhammer, and a dark-skinned man with a malicious aura and a crossbow, who seemed to be the best-prepared two for a melee. Moiloc notices a man sharpening his sword, and asks if it's his first time. He doesn't respond. Moiloc voices her anxiety over the upcoming melee, which the man still doesn't respond to, so Moiloc returns to the others in her team and prays to Shurima that he will protect her. Gertrude notices a blue, gilled man with a trident and a ranged weapon she doesn't recognize. He seems a bit unhinged, and might be the most aggressive of the competitors. Kaldrake notices a group of young locals who are shaking in fear seeing their competitors. 

Trumpets sound, Gertrude prepares to climb a tree, and Moiloc agrees to protect the base of the tree once she does so. However, the doors open, releasing them onto the beach of an ocean, with eight ships tied up that they can use to traverse the waters. On the far end of the stadium is another group of ships. 

> [!danger] Fight
> Kaldrake runs to one of the ships immediately, and begins cutting the ropes to release it. Gertrude is confused for a moment, wondering where the bears are, before proceeding to the boat and hopping on. Moiloc pushes the boat from the dock and hops on. However, there is a knight on board who is slashing down others who are attempting to hop on the boat. Moiloc notices them, and screams "truce?" their way. The knight charges her and slashes her with his sword. Kaldrake shoots him in defense with his crossbow, hitting the knight in the chest. Gertrude casts a spell to create a bonfire on the knight's location, but he jumps out of the way. Moiloc attacks again, but misses, as does the knight. Kaldrake hits again with his crossbow. Gertrude casts Shillelagh and hits the knight on his head hard, blood dripping from his helmet. Moiloc misses again, and the knight turns to Gertrude and strikes her with his sword. Kaldrake misses his next shot, but Gertrude is able to incapacitate the knight with one more bonk to the head. The helmet dents, and the knight goes down. Gertrude tells Moiloc to not ask for truces anymore. 

Finally at sea, the three each take up a post. Gertrude makes her way to the steering wheel after casting a snare on the base of the ramp up. Moiloc begins tossing the bodies on the ship overboard, and notices one last desperate challenger attempting to jump aboard, but missing and falling into the water. Kaldrake descends to the lower deck, and notices a series of ballistae, although it seems it is unable to be set with just him, so he calls Moiloc down. Gertrude begins steering the boat toward an island visible in the ocean, thinking it would be the most likely location of bears if they were being used in this challenge. Kaldrake unties the rope on a ballista to turn it into a harpoon, reasoning that it would be easier to sink ships than to drag them toward their ship and board it. The trio realizes that Pirate Bears would have been a better team name, but it's too late for that. What a terrible time for Kaldrake to receive a fantasy text from his fantasy mom on his fantasy phone asking what team name they decided on.
## Puzzle Dungeon 
Lexar and Branwyn make their way to the next room. It is a bedroom, furnished and carpeted, with three chests. Branwyn notices the left and right chests are wiggling, and the middle one is not. She readies her bow just in case as Lexar opens the middle chest to find a button at its base. He presses it, and the door opens. 

Entering the next room, the pair hears in their heads to "Kneel in a circle." Lexar wonders who Neil is. In the room are two statues, one in a red circle and one in a green circle. Lexar finds the statues to be identical, and suggests he and Branwyn kneel in the same circle as to not confirm that one of them will be punished. They kneel in the red circle, thinking it's a challenge of bravery, but it turned out to be a test of common sense, the ground burning both of them, and Lexar is downed. Branwyn heals him, but being hurt as well, decides to take a short rest in the dungeon before proceeding. 
## Arena
> [!danger] Fight
> Kaldrake and Moiloc prepare the first ballista-turned-harpoon, and Kaldrake shoots at a nearby ship, missing. The pair reload. Gertrude takes the moment of calm to heal herself after the knight's attack. Moiloc fires the ballista next, also missing. The pair reload. The ship they are aiming at takes notice of the assault, and turns in an attempt to ram into the party. Gertrude is able to avoid, as Kaldrake finally gets a shot off on the ship, tearing a hole in its side and revealing the lower decks on the other ship. People can be seen making their way to their own ballistae, and shoots back, physically clipping Kaldrake and Moiloc. 
> 
> A man with swords can be seen attempting to jump from his boat to Gertrude, but she is able to turn away, aiming to go the long way around the island to its back. Moiloc and Kaldrake reload once again, but before shooting, return to the upper deck after bearing Gertrude's struggles. As the boat turns around, two boats are now on their tail. Kaldrake evaluates the situation, seeing four of the eight boats at the entrance have been undocked, plus one which has already sunk. Kaldrake returns to man the ballista after suggesting Gertrude use her bonfire ability to burn other boats down. Moiloc prays to Shurima again. 
## Puzzle Dungeon
Branwyn and Lexar wake up after about an hour. In the next room, they see a chest which has already been opened, with the door already unlocked. 

The following room had five rugs arranged in an X, like the five pips on a die. On each one is a repeating pattern. One repeating pattern features one dot, one features two, and so on up to five. Under each rug is a letter, and when arranged in the order designated by the dots, the letters spell "STACK." They stack the rugs in order, and the door opens. 

The next room feels colder. In the center of the room are two elephant statues standing butt to butt. There is no handle on the back door. Each statue has a button on them, and Lexar again notes them to be identical. There are small gaps, about half an inch tall, on the side walls. Both Lexar and Branwyn climb onto an elephant, worrying something may come out of the gaps, and press the buttons at the same time. A countdown from ten begins and a blinding light comes from the gaps as the wall raises, and the gap widens, making it very difficult to see. The room also gets much colder, and once the countdown reaches three, it becomes cold enough that the pair worry they may not survive the cold temperatures. They react by holding their buttons, which breaks the timer, keeping it at ten, keeping the walls down, and keeping the lights off. Lexar summons an Invisible Servant to help with button experimenting, and it is realized that when the left button is pressed, the walls, countdown, and temperature are reset, and when the button it released, the temperature begins to drop, the walls begin to raise, and the countdown descends. The right button turns the lights off when pressed and on when released. After trying various things, the pair lets the countdown run to zero. This puzzle was the bravery puzzle, and the door opens. 

Behind the door is a hallway, which Lexar recognizes as the arena hallway. The hallway continues to the left, but there's a door on the right wall. Branwyn cracks it open to check inside, but the lights were off, which was enough to confirm to Lexar that the room is likely empty, so he opens the door, and sees a banner that reads "CONGRATULATIONS!" and a box. Lexar opens the box, finding a King's Seal. The pair at this point feel like about two hours have passed based on their perception of time, and so the pair make their way down the hall to try and quickly let the others know they have a seal, which may have been stolen from the melee, and to not enter the melee, as they now have a seal, and since the melee's reward may have just been stolen.
