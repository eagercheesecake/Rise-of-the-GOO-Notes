### Logline
Kaldrake enters Fort Bosco to get what he needs for his journey to Lothric. Branwyn and Brewster struggle to look for the Resistance in a town which is hostile to non-humans.
### Synopsis
Brewster, Branwyn, and Moiloc arrive to Lothric, and gain the attention of some beggars in the slums outside the border. Once entering, they gain papers, taking on disguises and fake names. Inside the city, they try and confront a shadowy figure which had been tailing them. Following it into the sewers, they find a dismembered arm, and decide to return to the surface, where they get a room at an inn and proceed to the bathhouse to wash off the sewers. They find a magical mask which can make the current wearer look like the previous wearer, and Brewster scares two children trying to get them to wear it. They eventually decide to use it on a man on the street, who notices and takes the mask. Branwyn and Brewster go to get it back, but end up killing the man and escaping into the sewers. Meanwhile, Kaldrake meets the Serene Mother inside Fort Bosco, where he is made to kill a non-human prisoner before collecting what he needs for his journey to Lothric. Jones is unable to resist the Serene Mother's commands, and Kaldrake ends up having to leave without him, instead taking Lortzgab, who he found as a prisoner about to be executed.
# Day 32
## Slums
[[Lothar (Brewster) Nash|Brewster]] wakes up [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] from the carriage as they arrive to the slums outside Lothric's gate. The slums are filled with non-humans who have lost or disfigured limbs. Brewster informs them that this town is relatively new, at least since [[King Endrio the Bold|Endrio's]] coronation, as it wasn't here when Brewster was here as a child. He also explains some information about the local government. The Cardinal Sphere consists of the six highest-ranking members of the Promised Church. One of their duties is to appoint the Saint, who is the head of the church, and resides in Lothric's Cathedral. In fact, many say that [[Queen Cypha]] married Endrio so the church could get an in with the government, and vice versa.

The group begin to make a plan to find the Resistance. The drakestone walls and closed gates make it near impossible to enter, so they decide to wait until morning and attempt to enter legally when the gates open. Branwyn takes the banner bearing Queen Cypha's sigil off the carriage, and takes watch while the others sleep.

During the night, a child approaches the horse and stares at it, unmoving. This turns out to be a distraction, as Branwyn feels the carriage slightly shake, and turns to see another child taking the wheels off the carriage. Branwyn tries to shoo him off, but he pleads with her, saying he needs to provide for his family. Branwyn says she has to do the same, and gives the child a couple gold to leave them alone.

In the morning, the group decides it would be best if Moiloc drives the cart, being the only human of the group. Three more children approach the cart, begging for more gold, and Moiloc gives each child a couple gold. Branwyn and Brewster tell Moiloc to rush along so they don't draw more attention. However, they find that they had forgotten to feed the horses since their long journey, and they were too tired to make it to the gates. Six more children approach, and the group decides it may be best to just enter the city by foot at this point, so they give the carriage and horses away to the townsfolk.

Brewster uses Disguise Self to disguise himself as a human. However, since he can't change his height, he disguises himself as a young child. Branwyn is able to pass as a human by putting her hood up, but prepares to use Disguise Self just in case. At the gate, the Inquisitor guard asks for their papers. Not having any, the group is taken to a small building nearby to get some written up.

Inside, an Inquisitor asks their names. Moiloc, panicking, says her name is Martha. The Inquisitor notices her panic, and asks for her real, full name. She apologizes, saying Martha is her middle name, she's actually Meredith Martha. The Inquisitor is getting frustrated, as Moiloc has still not provided a last name. She says her full name is Meredith Martha Moon, which the guard believes for some reason. Brewster and Branwyn introduce themselves as Brewster and Branwyn of Coryphea, the forest Branwyn grew up in, saying they are brother and sister.

The Inquisitor asks for the reason for their visit, and Moiloc says they are coming in from Amaris since Montrissad had been destroyed. The guard seems suspicious about this, so Brewster chimes in saying they're seeking asylum from non-humans (looking to his "older sister" to confirm he got the word "asylum" right). This excites the guard, who seems to believe them.

Branwyn asks why everyone in the slums is injured, and the Inquisitor informs them that they are put into the military to prove their allegiance to Wallachia. Some of them sold out their family instead. The Inquisitor then asks for the group to pay 20 gold to finalize their papers. The group gets the idea that this is an under-the-table payment, not a mandatory fee, but to avoid suspicion, Branwyn and Moiloc pay 10 gold each for the party. The Inquisitor pockets it all, and gives each of them a 6-day visa. He says a lot of non-humans are getting into the city recently, so they have to put a limit on visitor's stay. However, if they want citizenship, they can go to the Goldstrauss Bank.
## Lothric
Inside the town, the group sees a lot of people walking to the Cathedral of St. Laurien. At the front of the cathedral is a 80-foot statue of [[Eru]]. In fact, it seems that everyone who is out is heading to the Cathedral except them. The group begins to look around the city for a sigil that the Resistance will carve onto doors of buildings they use as safe houses. Brewster recalls talk of some being in the gold district, and some being in the market district.

After some searching, Brewster begins to notice shifting shadows in the alleyways. He brings the others to the alley to follow one, and they descend into the sewers when they see a sewer grate is ajar. Branwyn and Moiloc don't want to go in, but Brewster demands it, saying they owe it to him after they have repeatedly dragged him into terrible situations since they met. Moiloc agrees, and the group descends.
## Sewers
Brewster calls out, but nobody is around. They begin to follow the sewers in the direction of the inn, looking for anything suspicious on the way. After some time, Brewster sees a floating hand in the river. He uses [[Puck Nash|Puck]] to fish it out, and reveals that it isn't just a hand, but most of an arm. Brewster investigates it to find that a ring-sided chunk of flesh had been carved out. He remembers a story Daphne told him about a killer in Lothric whose victims would have their right arm cut off. Eight bells ring from the Cathedral, it is 8am.
## Fort Bosco
[[Jones]] informs [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] that Fort Bosco is where he trained. It is led by the Serene Mother, Hilda Halifax. At the fort's gate, Kaldrake announces that he is a Sootspot. The guard lets the pair in, and they notice that the army seems to be preparing for something. Jones seems more timid than usual. Inside the castle is a large sand pit in the courtyard, stained with dried blood, and with a flag perched in the middle.

A guard approaches Kaldrake and confirms he is a Sootspot when Kaldrake shows him his signet ring. The guard talks up [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth]] a bit, and tells Kaldrake to talk to the Serene Mother, saying she'll help him with whatever he needs. He also mentions a competition going on, with a special guest, which is due to start soon, saying it might be fun if Kaldrake joins. Kaldrake is trying his best to get in and out of the fort as fast as possible, so he denies this offer.

Kaldrake goes into the main hall and sees the Serene Mother, a mountain of a human, with a large scar extending over her entire face. She has a war hammer that is as imposing as she is. In front of her throne is a bloodied elf. The Serene Mother welcomes Kaldrake, saying to come closer and watch the show, and Jones immediately goes and kneels by the others. Kaldrake introduces himself, which seems to impress the Mother, who invites him to sit on the second throne by her side.

Kaldrake joins the Mother, and as the elf stands up, Kaldrake notices he has no nose, and is missing an eye. The Mother laments that she has gotten all the enjoyment she could from her toy, motioning to the elf, and asks Kaldrake what they should do with him. The elf pleads for his life, but the Mother knocks him back down with her hammer. Kaldrake winces back, saying he isn't the best choice for this, since he's squeamish, but the Mother won't take no for an answer, handing Kaldrake a knife. Kaldrake approaches the elf, and mouths that he is sorry, before slitting his throat.

The Mother approves, although mentions that it was a bit messy. She calls on Jones to clean it up, and he obliges. She also says Kaldrake can keep the knife as a memento of his first non-human kill, appraising his future acts as an Inquisitor. She invites Kaldrake to stick around, since Gwyneth and [[Corrin the Impaler]] are set to arrive in the coming week, who are especially esteemed guests, as Queen Cypha is aiming to crown a new Champion soon, and it seems that Gwyneth is a likely candidate. Again, wanting to leave soon, Kaldrake has to refuse the offer to stay, and he is pointed to the blacksmith down the hall to collect what he needs. As he leaves the room, a new prisoner is brought in, and he hears screams coming from behind him.

Down the hall is a human blacksmith. Kaldrake says the Mother sent him, and the blacksmith seems to act quickly out of fear. After hearing Kaldrake's list of items, he gives him his own smithing hammer, instead of the used one on the wall, and implores Kaldrake to tell the Mother he did well. Kaldrake also grabs some armor for his group, and returns to the main hall to leave.

In the hall, Kaldrake asks the Serene Mother where she sent Jones. She says to wait around for a bit, and after a few minutes, Jones and another guard bring in a new prisoner, who Kaldrake recognizes as [[Lortzgab]]. Trying to think of a plan of escape for everyone, Kaldrake offers to fight Lortzgab himself. The Serene Mother applauds this savagery, and tells Jones to give Lortzgab his sword. However, after a moment, Kaldrake tries to withdraw from the battle, saying he's above it, and asks again to take Jones - and Lortzgab - with him. The Serene Mother refuses to let Jones leave, saying he's too good of a follower, but that Kaldrake can take Lortzgab. But first, she starts to approach Lortzgab with her hammer to render her useless as an aide to Kaldrake. Kaldrake is able to get in with his shield, and gets very hurt in the process, but protects Lortzgab. The Serene Mother tells Kaldrake to move, and he takes Lortzgab, and Jones's sword, and runs. On their way out, the Serene Mother calls after them, saying to come back soon.
## Lothric
Moiloc, Branwyn, and Brewster leave the sewers. Moiloc attempts to buy something from the local apothecary, but they can't afford the prices. Brewster notices a magic artifact shop called the Emperor's Emporium, and the group enters. The shop is filled with scrying orbs. The group looks around for a bit, finding various magical artifacts, but their attention is drawn to a white masquerade mask. As they wonder what the non-labeled items do, asking each other if they can identify anything, an elderly man appears to answer their questions on his wares. The mask is imbued with transformation magic, allowing the wearer to transform into the last person who wore it. As Brewster puts it on, he transforms into Gwyneth, although the group does not recognize her, having never seen her. The group pool their funds to buy it to help Brewster remain disguised without using Disguise Self.

The group proceeds upstairs to find some mannequins wearing familiar clothing. Branwyn recognizes one mannequin is wearing [[Mora|Mora's]] cloak, and Moiloc recognizes her old, specialty-made armor which she lost in Montrissad. They summon the shopkeeper again, and he shows them that they are replicas, and not the actual original clothing they recognized them as. The shopkeeper explains that the cloak which looks like Mora's helps to cast spells. Branwyn wonders how the shopkeeper even knows of Mora in the first place, but he dodges the question. As for the armor Moiloc recognized, the shopkeeper explains it is a replica of Celica the Good's armor. Moiloc recognizes this name as belonging to the 2000-year-old patron god of charity, and recalls some stories of her freeing enslaved peoples and disappearing with Eru's rise. However, the shopkeeper's story doesn't fully make sense to Moiloc, since as far as she knows, the armor was custom-made for her mom.

Feeling suspicious about this man, Moiloc asks his name. He responds, but the party seems to be unable to remember it. The shopkeeper gives Brewster a lollipop on the way out, and they leave the store. Upon leaving, Moiloc finds that the store had disappeared. She points this out to Branwyn and Brewster, who find they don't remember the shop at all. Moiloc explains what happened to them, and uses the mask, which Brewster still has, as proof that their time in the shop actually occurred.

The trio proceed to the Waltzing Weasel. The innkeeper, Mama Myrtle, points out that they smell awful, from their time in the sewers. They purchase a room, and the innkeeper points them to a nearby bathhouse. Before Brewster's Disguise Self expires, he decides to use the opportunity to get the mask set up. Since the last person to use it was him, wearing it wouldn't disguise him as anyone, but since his papers say he's a child, he decides he needs to find a child to put the mask on so he can still use his visa.

In the bathhouse, Brewster approaches a child, introducing himself as a tourist. He asks if he should check out the Church while in town, which scares the child, who realizes that Brewster hadn't gone to church. Brewster finishes bathing and hurriedly leaves before he raises too much suspicion from not being a churchgoer. In the changing room, Brewster tries again, walking up to another child and tagging him, trying to get him to follow so Brewster can quickly put the mask on him. The child, obviously, doesn't follow.

Brewster reunites with Branwyn and Moiloc, and they decide to ditch the effort to put a mask on a child and just pay for new papers if they need to. They find a man standing alone, and Brewster attempt to use Mage Hand to place the mask on him and quickly retrieve it. However, he isn't stealthy enough, and the man plucks it from the air, puts it on momentarily, not noticing he turns into Brewster, and then pockets it.

Having paid way too much money to lose the mask, the group decides to tail him. Moiloc stays behind, since her armor makes it difficult to tail someone without being heard. Branwyn and Brewster follow the man to a bakery, where he apparently works. The pair enter, and Branwyn tells a sob story of her husband losing their daughter, [[Charlotte]]. She says she thinks Charlotte came in here, and asked if she could check for her in the back. The baker, who introduces himself as Dave, says she isn't back there. The other baker working says he'll leave to find an Inquisitor to help look for Charlotte, leaving the bakery. While Branwyn cries and makes a scene, Brewster takes advantage of the distraction to try and sneak behind the counter and grab the mask from Dave's bag on the ground, before the Inquisitors show up.

However, Brewster is caught, and Dave picks him up to remove him from behind the counter. When picking him up, Dave realizes that Brewster doesn't feel right, and sees through the Disguise. He begins to panic at the sight of a non-human, preparing to call the Inquisitors to arrest them, and Brewster pleads for Branwyn to hit Dave so he'll drop him. Branwyn does so, but with a bit too much strength, killing him with her bow. Panicking as the Inquisitors are likely approaching, the pair grab Dave's bag, and try to escape through the back. However, the back is just a storage area, with no second exit.

The other baker returns with an Inquisitor, who immediately notes the murder which has taken place. Brewster casts Invisibility on himself and sneaks out to an alley across the street, while Branwyn tries to Misty Step for the front door and leave without being noticed, but is seen as she appears in front of the door, inside the bakery.
## Sewers
The Inquisitor slashes at Branwyn, who disengages and makes a break for the alley as well. Brewster and Branwyn both escape into a sewer grate in the alley, but the Inquisitor follows, calling for a few more nearby Inquisitors to follow as well. The whole thing causes a scene, and many people see Branwyn's face. Inside the sewers, Brewster kills the initial Inquisitor with Melf's Acid Arrow. Branwyn casts Spike Growth so the others have difficulty following, and they are able to escape, losing the Inquisitors in the sewers. Brewster gives a healing potion to Branwyn, and they proceed deeper into the sewers, hoping to find an escape close to the gold district so they find the Resistance quickly, before being caught.
## Lothric
After some time without her friends returning, Moiloc decides to explore the city. She heads to the Cathedral and looks around. While there, she overhears someone saying the owe money to [[The Goat]]. Through the conversation Moiloc learns he is lending out of a house in the noble district, and often lends to religious figures, since religious figures can't borrow from the bank as it's against Eru's ways. She also overhears something about a murder in a nearby bakery.

Inside the Cathedral grounds is an unfinished statue of [[Pontiff Sulyvahn|Sulyvahn]], as well as a statue of each member of the Cardinal Sphere. The first statue is Ludmilla VonCarstein, the Merciful Mother and the Cardinal of Lothric, embedded with amethyst. The next is the Serene Mother. The next is Walter Dornez, the Heavenly Father, also from Lothric, and embedded with emerald.

Moiloc proceeds to the gold district to look for signs of the Resistance. On her way, she is stopped by Inquisitors, who check her papers. They approve, but recommend she goes to the Goldstrauss bank for citizenship, saying it should be pretty easy since she's human.

Moiloc also finds a wanted poster of Branwyn and the child Brewster was disguised as. While looking at the posters, she is approached by a man in a floppy hat, who introduces himself as [[Tobias Grand]], a bounty hunter. He takes notice in her interest in the bounty board, and hands her a card for the Bounty Guild, suggesting she join. He says they work with the Queen to catch bounties, and it may help her gain citizenship. Moiloc thanks him, and he leaves. Without any more leads, Moiloc proceeds to return to the hotel.
## Fort Bosco
Kaldrake, realizing he didn't really get most of what he wanted to in Fort Bosco, re-enters, under the guise of throwing Lortzgab to the wolves. He pays for three horses from the stable hand, and returns to [[Goro Hattori|Goro]], [[Skalazar]], and [[Belnades]] informing them that Lortzgab will be replacing Jones on their journey. Nobody seems to mind. Goro feeds Lortzgab some rabbit he had made in their absence. Lortzgab says she has business in the capital, and will join them on their journey.

Kaldrake fills Lortzgab in on everything that had happened to him since they were separated. Saying it all out loud sends him into a bit of a depressive state, and Goro notices, suggesting they all get some rest. Kaldrake says he doesn't want to sleep, in case another dream happens, and Goro decides they should all just pack up and begin on their way to Lothric.
