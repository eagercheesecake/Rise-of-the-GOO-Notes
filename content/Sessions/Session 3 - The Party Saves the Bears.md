### Logline
*Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Moiloc try to protect a new friend from the dangers of the Grand Melee.*
### Synopsis
Branwyn and Lexar root the team on from the stands. Gertrude, Moiloc, and Kaldrake begin to make their way toward a lone island in the arena as their ship takes damage. Gertrude notices some druidic writing that leads the trio to an area under the tower on the island, where they find two surviving bears. The mother is mortally wounded, and Kaldrake puts her out of her misery as Gertrude and Moiloc take the younger bear, who they name Pine. As they are attacked by one remaining team, the team makes their way to the top of the tower, where they find a flag which teleports them back to the docks, where they wait out the rest of the game in relative safety. After winning, the group makes their way back to the in with their two seals to debrief. Lexar returns to his house to sleep.
# Day 3
## Arena
As [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]], [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]], and [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] approach the island, they notice a tower. In preparation for a possible battle and with five boats still standing, Gertrude heals Moiloc's wounds. A tailing boat takes two shots at the party's ship, hitting once and dealing a good amount of damage to its structure. Kaldrake and Moiloc make an attempt to retaliate, and are able to get a hit in as well.

The crew notices a ship has beaten them to the island, and it appears its crew has left to explore the island. The ship which hit the party's vessel is attacked by another boat. Moiloc and Kaldrake tie a torch to the ballista and attempt to attack these other ships, but miss. The two opposing ships begin fighting each other, but one misses the other in such a way that causes them to hit and utterly destroy the bottom decks of the party's ship, hitting Kaldrake with a ballista in the process. The ship begins taking in water, Moiloc misses one last shot as the ship sinks, and Gertrude is barely able to get the ship to the island before it goes down.

Upon exiting the ship, Gertrude makes out a bear call, still thinking bears are being utilized in this arena. Surprisingly, she gets two responses, one of which seems to be an angry or otherwise emotional bear, while the other is clearly a human responding with a bear call of their own.

Meanwhile, [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] and [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] begin their attempt to tell their teammates they have a seal before the melee begins. However, around the corner from the room in which they took the seal, they find a room with two stationed orc guards around a table. Lexar uses Timothy, his Unseen Servant, to knock over the table and run out one of the doors at the other end of the room. To his surprise, instead of following the ruckus, the guards blamed each other, and one immediately takes a sword to the throat and dies. The victorious guard leaves the room through the other door at the far end of the room, opposite of where Timothy left. Lexar examines the corpse, finding 10 gold and a letter, and noticing that the guard seems to be a member of the Montrissad royal guard. Lexar and Branwyn follow the door Timothy left through, although the distance was great enough between Lexar and Timothy that the spell was broken and Timothy disappeared.

The door led outside, to what Lexar recognizes as an alleyway two streets over from the arena. The pair rush to the arena, to find it empty. A guard informs them that the melee had already begun, and Lexar and Branwyn realize that time passed differently while they were in the puzzle dungeon. Lexar introduces Branwyn to local Montrissad delicacy, lizard on a stick, while looking for their teammates, and Branwyn is surprised to like it. The pair find their teammates on a board which lists the competitors in the melee. Although Lexar and Branwyn wouldn't recognize the name, [[Jacob]], the pet shop owner that Gertrude met on her first day in town, is also on the participant list.

Gertrude hops on Moiloc's back since she is slower than the others, as to not slow down the search of the island and escape from armed ships. Upon investigating the tower, the trio don't see any entrances, but are soon met by the crew of the ship that beat them to the island

>[!danger] Fight
>A rogue gets Kaldrake in the back with a dagger. Gertrude attempts to burn the enemies with her Campfire ability, which sets the flammable grass and nature aflame, although this is enough for Lexar and Branwyn to be able to pinpoint the trio from the stands. A warrior with plate armor slashes Moiloc hard, really weakening her. Moiloc is able to attack back and kill the warrior. Kaldrake is able to hit back the rogue that hit him, causing the rogue's arm to go limp, but the rogue diverts to attack Gertrude. An archer joins the fight, shooting at and missing Gertrude, but hitting Moiloc. Moiloc's health is dangerously low, and she uses Second Wind to heal herself. Moiloc hits the rogue, causing him to fall, and the archer breaks his bow, causing him to have to charge the group. Kaldrake attampts to finish the rogue, but misses and takes a step back to heal with Second Wind. Gertrude finishes off the rogue with Shillelagh, and Moiloc pierces the archer through his chest, also killing him.

Hurt, Moiloc takes a moment to lean against the tower as the others investigate for an entrance to the tower. They notice a balcony about 35 feet up in the tower, but no way to reach it. Gertrude's wildfire is spreading and threatening to overtake the team, when Gertrude notices some druidic writings pointing to a nearby tree. She climbs the tree, finding nothing, but Moiloc begins to dig around the tree and finds an opening to a cave. Moiloc, Gertrude, and Kaldrake enter, after Moiloc gives a hearty "hello?" to let her presence be known to any possible future friends. Gertrude notices one more druidic message, a hasty "keep safe."

Scurrying can be heard as Moiloc lights her torch and begins the descent into the cave. On his way down, Kaldrake notices another ship, with a broken mast, dock onto the island, seemingly the victor from the earlier fight they left behind. The party is met with two branches of the cave upon entering.

To the left, the group finds a very hurt brown bear. Gertrude is quickly able to calm it, but it has taken a spear to the side, and the party had already used most of their healing. Kaldrake noticed the bear was likely not going to make it, and suggests they put it out of its misery. A scared, very young [[Pine|cub]] is found cowering behind the adult bear, and Gertrude takes it to safety. Moiloc follows, leaving Kaldrake to put the bear out of its misery. Feeling like he should say something, Kaldrake goes with "sorry for your loss." With only a morning star, Kaldrake is able to take the bear out with one blunt hit. It's worth noting this is his first kill.

Gertrude puts the cub in Moiloc's backpack as they ascent the ladder in the other branch of the cave, into the tower. As they reach the top of the tower, Lexar and Branwyn begin making their way over to the tower, as it may be close enough that they could communicate. Lexar grabs some more lizards on the way to give to his teammates in the arena as a victory prize.

Upon looking out over the tower, the trio sees the fire has begun to dissipate a bit, and a fourth ship has docked on the island. On the top of the tower is a chest and a flag. Gertrude opens the chest and is rewarded with a king's seal. Kaldrake prepares his bow in defense of any possible unwelcome guests, and Moiloc grabs the flag, noticing it's a bit warm to the touch.

Bangs are heard from the base of the tower, and Kaldrake looks over the edge to see a group of four using the broken mast of their ship as a battering ram to take the tower down. Kaldrake shoots one of them, but they shoot a firebolt back, downing Kaldrake. Moiloc Lays Hands on Kaldrake after noticing he's down for the count, and is able to stabilize him. The tower begins to shake and crumble, and the group heads back down to the cave to seek safety. Thinking of possible escapes, the idea comes up to have all three of them touch the flag. They do so, and are teleported back to the docks they started at.

On the docks is an armored man, leaning on his sword over four corpses. He looks exhausted. Moiloc loudly asks if he is a friend or foe, but gets no response. She approaches him, asking if he's okay, but upon reaching out to him, he topples over. She is able to determine that he is alive. Gertrude holds the seal to the locked entrance door, to no avail. Without anything to do, Moiloc goes to the stands to hype them up. They begin chanting "Moiloc" repeatedly, as Moiloc pushes the unconscious warrior into the water and lets him drown.

Kaldrake takes a nap due to being so beaten up. A few names remain on the board, but as the tower collapses, the trio are the only remaining survivors. Gertrude notices that Jacob has died and mourns for a moment. Kaldrake wakes up as the bardcore Hips Don't Lie national anthem begins playing. Moiloc basks in the audience's praise. Lexar and Branwyn are able to push their way through to the front of the audience, and Lexar throws down a lizard on a stick to each teammate. Gertrude gives hers to the cub.

The guards take the victorious three to a room full of treasure, gold, weapons, and other loot. There's an old man in the room who doesn't introduce himself, which Gertrude audible declares as rude. The man apologizes, informing her that he's blind. He says that in addition to the seal, each victor may take one item from the room. Gertrude takes the Glasses of the Eagle, increasing her sight. Moiloc gets a magic golden sword with a lion head on its hilt. Kaldrake gets the Bracers of the Ogre, a set of bracers which increase his strength. The victors also each get 50 gold. Gertrude mourns Lexar and Branwyn aloud for a moment, before Gertrude and Kaldrake inform her that they were clearly alive, in the stands, and throwing lizards on sticks at them. Kaldrake checks his fantasy phone to see that he missed a fantasy text from his fantasy mom during the battle telling him she heard about the rules of the Games and worries about his safety.
## The Hatched Pig Inn
The five reunite in Moiloc's room at the Hatched Pig's Inn to debrief on the day. Branwyn eats her first orange, and the others trick her into eating it without peeling it. The group decides to name the cub Pine, and Branwyn and Lexar are confused about the new name choice the team decided on while they were away. Kaldrake and Branwyn retire to their own rooms, and Gertrude, who had been sleeping in the stables until that point, spends the night in Moiloc's room with Pine. Lexar returns to his place after giving everyone his address in case they need to reach him, where he finds a package waiting for him at the foot of his bed, a grey behelit and a note reading to "follow the light" when it appears to him, and to proceed with the games.

Moiloc sees [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] in a dream. He sticks his crooked finger into her eye, further and further, but when his hand is flush with her face, she wakes up. She notes a ring with an eye on it had appeared on her hand, and hears Shurima in her head say "follow the path of your heart, you'll find what you seek."
