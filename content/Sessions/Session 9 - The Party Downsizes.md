# Day 26
## Illusory Forest
[[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] wakes up in her home grove, recognizing the smell of wet bear. She looks for [[Pine]], but he is nowhere to be found. In the distance, Gertrude sees her home cabin. She quickly enters it, looking forward to seeing her bears again, but upon entering sees her favorite bear, Emerald, dead on the floor, blood still flowing. She rushes to Emerald but the bear is beyond help. Gertrude angrily rushes to leave, but finds that she has been locked inside. She begins to hear eldritch laughing from all around her. She knocks her staff against the window in an attempt to break it and escape, but it bounces off as if the window were made of rubber. Gertrude screams that if whoever is doing this to her fucks with her bears, then they are fucking with her, too. The walls begin closing in on her, more voices begin joining in with the laughter, and the smell of dead bear intensifies. Gertrude recognizes the voices as members of her family. In a panic, Gertrude casts Shillelagh, but the spell fizzles, and soon after Gertrude's vision goes black, but she remains conscious. She attempts to clutch to Emerald, but upon reaching out finds Emerald is gone. Instead, she feels the bark of a tree where Emerald once was. Reaching to the floor, she finds it is no longer the wooden floor of her cabin, but grass.

Gertrude casts Detect Magic, and upon casting it the illusion is dispersed, and she finds herself in an unknown forest, touching an old, gnarled tree. Her Detect Magic spell comes up with nothing. Gertrude attempts to climb the tree to get a better view of the forest and locate herself, but the tree is swaying as if it were a living creature, and Gertrude is unable to keep her grip enough to climb it. Gertrude hears muffled voices from the tree, and upon putting her ear to it, hears the word "[[Maokai]]" emanating from the tree. She asks if the tree can understand her, but it just keeps repeating the same word.

Gertrude checks another nearby tree, but the other trees in the forest seem normal as far as she can tell. The living tree's swaying becomes writhing as the tree seems to get angrier. The ground shifts under Gertrude, and the tree stands up. The bark of the tree morphs into a face. Gertrude tries to communicate with the tree again, but it's still just screaming "Maokai" louder and louder. Gertrude notices the nearby wildlife seems to not hear this, or simply not mind, as they aren't running from the tree.

Eventually, Gertrude says "Maokai" back, and the tree stops and looks at her as if it is studying her. The tree then swings a branch at Gertrude, but it stops right before hitting her. Vines wrap around her and she is lifted to the top of the tree, where she can see a seemingly endless forest. The tree then starts communicating with Gertrude telepathically. It tells her she is in Maokai's realm, and has been chosen to protect the forest. Only Gertrude can save the forest, and it is her purpose, the end of a path that began with her leaving her family. Gertrude says she appreciates the gesture, but ultimately has bears she needs to take care of and can't abandon, especially in her old age. She also brings up that she's already on an adventure. The tree emphasizes that Maokai chose her, and that this isn't really her choice, and she asks to speak with Maokai. The tree settles back down to the ground before pushing Gertrude inside its trunk through the bark.

The trunk is hollow and leads down to a larger chamber below the tree. Inside is a glowing green orb melded into the wall. Gertrude asks if this is Maokai, and the orb responds that he is, and that Gertrude is his champion. Gertrude asks why she was chosen, and Maokai explains that she is the person most devoted to nature in Phaeros. Gertrude then asks about her vision of her dead bear, and learns that it is what will come if she refuses Maokai's offer. Gertrude refuses to believe it is already certain, and that she can act to change the vision without accepting the offer, but asks Maokai to elaborate on what he would have her do.

Maokai asks that Gertrude kills the threat to nature. Maokai himself cannot go to Phaeros, as he has been banished and can't exist in Phaeros, only able to interact with it in small ways like speaking to Gertrude through her dreams. Gertrude expresses that she doesn't want Maokai to give her any more nightmares like her vision of her bear, and Maokai says he won't go that far again, but warns that she will begin experiencing waking nightmares if she does not help him stop the threat to nature. The threat is stated to be a with that banished Maokai to this realm. He asks Gertrude to bring him the witch's heart.

Gertrude vaguely knows of Maokai from her own experiences with nature. Although he hasn't been worshiped in a long time, since modern industrialization when humans began separating from their relationship to nature, he was once regarded as the Protector of the Forest. Gertrude inquires more about the witch, and Maokai says he only knows her name: Mora. He does also know that her heart is rumored to be below Maedrosi. If Gertrude could complete her task, Maokai could be reborn and return Phaeros to nature. Maokai claims that man has abandoned nature, and thus has abandoned the way of the world, and wishes to return humanity to it. Gertrude asks if this means cities will be leveled, and Maokai confirms that beasts and nature would destroy anything unnatural.

At this point Gertrude is more adamantly against this plan. She asks what will happen if she refuses, and Maokai says Mora will likely destroy the world. Gertrude tries to sway Maokai, saying it isn't right to kill off a large portion of humanity and their accomplishments as his plan to return to nature would require. Maokai explains that all people die, and he is only offering Gertrude an opportunity to delay their deaths. Gertrude tries once more to ask for more information, but Maokai stops her, adamant that she doesn't have a choice in this.

Gertrude gives in, and asks if Pine if safe. Maokai confirms and says he'll return Gertrude to Pine. First, he gives her bark skin, promising more boons as he can provide them. Gertrude is a little against the bark skin, saying it might scare Pine, but Maokai seems done with her, and does not respond. Gertrude is shot out of the trunk of the tree, and begins falling back to the forest floor. Upon hitting it, she blacks out.
## Forest
Gertrude wakes up in a forest at about midnight. She gets her bearings and recognizes it as the forest outside of Brasov. She climbs a nearby tree, and sees smoke rising from Brasov, and notices that the Wavecrasher is also gone. Without much direction, Gertrude tries to get her group's attention by skywriting "WOKE UP IN FOREST MEET ME HERE LOVE GERTRUDE." She then calls for Pine, although she doesn't get a response. She begins making a shelter for the night between two trees with sticks and leaves. It had recently rained, and she could only make a small, smoky fire. She uses some granola from her pocket to set a trap, puts out the fire, and goes to sleep for the night.
## Monastery
[[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] and [[Violet]] make it outside the walls of Brasov from the Monastery. Violet says she's going to the rebel hideout in Dunn, and offers Kaldrake to come with her, but soon after a guard posted on the city wall sees the pair. Three guards give chase, and is gaining on them until Violet pulls Kaldrake into some nearby brambles and casts Thaumaturgy to make it sound like they had jumped into the ocean, distracting the guards. Violet and Kaldrake take this opportunity to escape into the forest, but soon find themselves lost, and soon hear the guards again. Violet is able to orient herself, and points south, the direction of the hideout. Kaldrake, getting hot, takes off the Inquisitor garb, and Violet takes it for possible rebel use.

They're able to hide away, and overhear the guards discussing "theologian rebels," a group of non-humans fighting against the church, likely Violet's rebels. Kaldrake has to silence his fantasy phone so he misses a fantasy text from his fantasy mom expressing concern over his location on fantasy Life360. After some hiding, the guards pass by, and Violet and Kaldrake set up for the night. Violet admits they made good progress today on the rebel's missions, but that things are likely going to get worse before they get better.
## Shoreline
[[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], [[Goro Hattori|Goro]], and [[Belnades]] continue to silently follow the shoreline in the direction [[Skalazar]] was told to steer the Wavecrasher. After walking for some time, the group sees the ship, but also sees an Inquisitor frigate behind, attacking. Belnades attempts to shoot the attacking frigate with fire, but misses, hitting the Wavecrasher instead. Lexar misconstrues this, and points out to Goro that they should not have trusted her. The three begin swimming to the Wavecrasher.

Upon boarding, they see [[David]] throwing hammers at the attackers, and Skalazar standing on a box attempting to steer the ship away. [[Lortzgab]] is casting at the attackers. Goro boots Skalazar from the wheel to try and steer the ship away faster, but the only sail is ablaze from Belnades's spell. Goro recognizes that the ship is unsalvageable, and tells the group to jump ship. He grabs Aslan, but the frigate rams into the Wavecrasher, and its back crumples away, the ship beginning to sink. Lortzgab begins working on another teleportation circle for a quick escape to a distant location. The other ship is much bigger, and two Inquisitors jump from it and board the Wavecrasher.

> [!danger] Fight
> The first inquisitor slashes Lortzgab's arm. [[Jiren]] turns into a toad and attacks this Inquisitor to allow Lortzgab to return to concentrating on the teleportation circle. David helps by throwing a hammer at the Inquisitor, and Lexar also sends an Eldritch Blast his way, but misses. The Inquisitor again slashes at Lortzgab, and Jiren tries to catch back up. David approaches and hits the Inquisitor in the head with a hammer, and the Inquisitor drops.
> 
> Another Inquisitor boards, and Lexar immediately hits them with an Eldritch Blast. The Inquisitor pulls out a saber and slashes at Lexar. Jiren is able to attack the Inquisitor as a toad, but David misses and drops his hammer. The Inquisitor again slashes at Lexar. Jiren is able to get another hit in, but Lexar isn't able to land another attack before the Inquisitor slashes one final time, causing Lexar to fall to the ground, incapacitated. David sees this, and in a rage picks up his hammer and kills the Inquisitor.

Goro attempts to help Lexar, but is unable to aide quick enough, and Lexar succumbs to his wounds. The last thing Lexar sees is Goro picking up [[King Aslan]] in preparation to escape.
# Day 27
## Grima's Grove
[[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] wakes up in a memory, from when she was about nine years old. She experiences a painful chomp, and feels indents on her shoulder, causing her to wake up. She inspects her shoulder to find massive bite wounds from a beast with almost jagged teeth. It seems to be scabbing quickly.

Branwyn calls to [[Grima]], and asks what it means to be a vessel of [[Mora]]. Grima explains that Mora is a witch who stays alive by taking the bodies of her children to inhabit. Branwyn says she hasn't noticed any lapse of time, and doesn't recall any possession, despite supposedly being a vessel. Grima asks when the last time she saw Mora was, suggesting it would likely be around the age of eighteen, which Branwyn confirms.

Branwyn tells Grima about her dream. Grima expresses interest, saying she may be a green dreamer. She is able to see into the veil, in a sense, but it isn't a dream. He expresses that it makes sense Mora would have interest in this. Branwyn shows the bitemarks on her shoulder, and Grima's interest is replaced with confusion, and then fear. He says Branwyn must leave immediately, that she is inviting evil into his Grove. Branwyn apologizes, saying it wasn't her intention to do so. Grima gives her a wooden ring, telling her to always wear it, and to never take it off for any reason.

Branwyn wakes Moiloc and the two hurriedly leave the Grove. Grima gives the pair a bag of food each, and tells them the location of Dunn, where they might be able to get some aide. Moiloc asks Grima if he has any final advice for her. He simply tells her not to trust her master.

Branwyn and [[Moiloc Kodlaksdottër|Moiloc]] consider their next move, but decide they need to find Charlotte, so they wait to approach the docks under the cover of night.
## Dunn
Kaldrake and Violet approach Dunn, and [[Violet]] points out a palisade in the distance. The pair approach, revealing a makeshift camp, seemingly made in the ruins of an abandoned and run-down village. A large, burly [[Loktar Malgoth|ogre]] with dreadlocks excitedly runs up to Violet upon seeing her. Violet introduces him to Kaldrake as Loktar. Loktar says there is a lot of news, and introduces himself to Kaldrake. Violet explains that Kaldrake is a friend who saved her.

A hill giant, [[Bogart]], comes and picks up Violet and Kaldrake in a big hug, saying he's so happy Violet is home. After the two are put down, Violet passes Kaldrake to Loktar, saying he will catch him up on the rebels while Violet reports what happened to the camp. Loktar expresses an interest in what happened with Kaldrake and Violet, and Kaldrake fills him in. Loktar shows Kaldrake to a bed, passing by smiling faces and children playing in the village. The main tent is pretty lavish, with exotic furs, and an unclaimed bed for Kaldrake, who is happy to have a real bed to rest after a night of making his way to Dunn.
## Forest
Gertrude wakes up rested, but also a bit disappointed that her sky writing didn't appear to attract anyone. A squirrel had triggered the trap, and Gertrude befriends it, asking if they had seen Pine, or any bears, but the squirrel hasn't seen them and refuses to go searching for the predator. Gertrude, unsure of where else to turn, begins returning to Brasov.
## Brasov
Moiloc and Branwyn get to Brasov, but smell burning as they approach. They see armored guards marching nearby, and use the city walls to hide. Moiloc worries the guards might be looking for them after the person who overheard them discussing going against the Inquisitors, but Branwyn points out it seems to be in response to something much, much bigger. Branwyn notices there are no guards at the main gate at the time, and they use their opportunity to sneak in.

They notice some commotion around a pillar of smoke emanating from the market square. Branwyn and Moiloc make their way to Jessie's, thinking their rebel meeting may be their best shot of safety in the city. The inn is locked when they arrive, and there's no answer when Moiloc knocks. Moiloc tries to open a window, but accidentally snaps it out of the wall, and it loudly shatters on the ground. Moiloc uses her dagger to clear the broken glass from the window and the pair enter the inn. Branwyn looks around the bar area, and notices that a tap is askew. Reminded of Jim's secret entrance, she pulls on the tap. Some floorboards slide away, revealing a ladder.

The two descend to a long, winding tunnel with a large circular door at the other end. Branwyn hears faint talking from the other side. Knowing [[Terren Hammerfist|Terren]] is supposed to attend the meeting, Branwyn uses Disguise Self to disguise herself as him, and knocks on the door. The talking immediately stops. After a few moments of silence, Branwyn feels something is wrong, and pulls Moiloc away from the door. Soon after, the door explodes open, blown to splinters.

Branwyn, being the only one with dark vision, rushes in, and is immediately punched by Terren, the force of the punch showing Hammerfist isn't just a name. Moiloc illuminates her fire sword, and the real Terren recognizes her. Branwyn is really hurt from the punch, and Terren allows Moiloc space to heal Branwyn a bit. Terren leads the two to an entrance to another tunnel. He informs them [[Jessie Harkness|Jessie]] and [[Charlotte]] should be on the other side.

Gertrude arrives to Brasov and finds the gates are closed to non-humans. The guard tells her to leave before they kill her. Gertrude moves out of sight and turns into a pigeon. She flies over Brasov, where some citizens still remain, and the pyres from last night's burnings had not yet been deconstructed. She flies over to the docks, and recognizes Skalazar scrubbing the decks of one of the ships.

Gertrude lands on the boat and turns into a rat, going beneath the boat, where Goro and David are chained as prisoners. In an attempt to communicate with them, Gertrude scratches a "G" nearby them.  There are three guards also in the room. Gertrude prays to Maokai, but gets no response. She assumes it is because she is not in an area connected to nature, and may only be able to reach him in a forest. Unsure how to help her friends, she leaves the boat and returns to the forest, where she asks Maokai for guidance again. She feels his presence but does not receive a response, as if Maokai is ignoring her. Sensing she may have insulted him by denying his offer, she apologizes, and expresses mild appreciation for her bark shin.
# Day 28
## Dunn
Moiloc, Branwyn, and Terren make their way to Dunn through the tunnel after a long night. Terren tells them Loktar will get them caught up, and explains that Loktar was at war but returned to aid the rebels once he heard of their plight. He also tells them of an iron [[Ouroborus Tikktal|dragon]] in the mines, but says the dragon wants visitors to have proven themselves before allowing a visit. Moiloc, having studied dragons, realizes how rare a find this is, since after the war between dragons 100 years ago, only four or five are still in existence. However, Moiloc first wants to meet the leader of the camp. Terren tells them to talk to Loktar to learn more about the camp, and also informs Branwyn that Charlotte is in the cave.

The pair begin by talking to Loktar, who directs them to [[Haru Hattori|Haru]], the camp blacksmith. Moiloc makes it clear to Loktar that she plans to topple the Wallachian government. Loktar says he is a highly decorated general from the Orkus Badlands with the same motive.

The pair go to the cave, where Haru is working. She is heavily scarred, and one of her legs are prosthetic. She bears a striking resemblance to Goro. Branwyn asks for a bow and arrow, but Haru says she only forges weapons, and that she should talk to a raider in camp named [[Gorm]]. They were just planning to use excess bows as firewood, so they're up for grabs. Branwyn goes to the tent labelled "GORM" and retrieves a bow and some arrows.
