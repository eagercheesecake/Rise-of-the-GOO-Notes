### Logline
*Branwyn, Moiloc, and Kaldrake meet the others in the local Resistance. The trio brings a scientist from Dunn to the Chateau to investigate rumors of information related to ydril.*
### Synopsis
Branwyn and Moiloc gather replacements in Dunn for their lost armor and weapons, and reunite with Charlotte and Kaldrake. The group meets Brewster, a local scientist in Dunn who is investigating the effects of ydril. Moiloc reveals her true intentions with her diplomatic mission, and her relation with Shurima, causing tension within the group. Violet asks the trio to bring Brewster to the Chateau to investigate rumors of information on ydril. In the Chateau, the group learns of more information related to the Braeton House, and find a horde of vampires and mysterious remnants of magic throughout the house. Also discovered is a deed to the mine in Dunn and blueprints for a ydril laboratory. An encounter with a vampiric Carmine Braeton kills Kaldrake and Moiloc, although Branwyn is able to choose one to be revived after finding a scroll on Carmine's corpse. She brings Moiloc back, and the group brings Kaldrake's corpse back to Dunn.
# Day 28
## Dunn Cave
[[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] finish recuperating their lost weaponry at [[Gorm|Gorm's]] Moiloc is unable to find the armor she was hoping for, and returns to [[Haru Hattori|Haru]], who points her to a pile of old, mangled armor in the back of her forge. Moiloc is able to find padded leather armor, although it is immensely torn and tattered, and a wooden shield, also worn.

Branwyn and Moiloc proceed to the cave, hoping to find [[Charlotte]]. Inside the cave is a small community of tents, and a little less than ten children. Charlotte is among them, reading a book, and upon seeing Branwyn runs to hug her in a heartwarming reunion. Nearby, [[Jessie Harkness|Jessie]] is tending to another child's scraped knee. Moiloc approaches and attempts to comfort the child, but is beyond awkward doing so. After the child leaves, Moiloc catches Jessie up on all that she has missed. Jessie extends an invitation to Moiloc to join the Rebellion, which she accepts. Jessie tells Moiloc of an experiment being worked on nearby, looking into the manufacturing process and effects of ydril. Moiloc tells Jessie to keep an eye out for the other missing party members, and returns to Branwyn to fill her in on the ydril manufacturing and Rebellion. Charlotte promises Branwyn that [[Loktar Malgoth|Loktar]] will keep her safe, and points out where the raider's tent is so they can rest when they are ready. Moiloc tells Charlotte to stay where she is and read, coming off awkward and a little pushy. Moiloc is bad with children. Branwyn tells Charlotte to let Jessie know if she needs anything, and she and Moiloc proceeds to the ydril experiment Moiloc was told about.

The laboratory is in the back of the same cave, using the cave's crystals to attempt to synthesize ydril. Inside the building is a man who is dressed like a [[Dr. Nubgrub|plague doctor]] dissecting a corpse. He's clearly inexperienced, and it's almost as if he's learning how to work on a corpse as he's going. Behind him is a gruff [[Lothar (Brewster) Nash|rock gnome]], covered in various powders and alchemical ingredients, and some flecks of dried blood, likely from the splash zone of the plague doctor's work. The gnome is leaning over some sort of experiment, seemingly unconcerned about the doctor's activities. Moiloc approached the plague doctor, who introduces himself as Dr. Nubgrub, and extends a blood-soaked hand, which Moiloc refuses. Moiloc questions if the doctor knows what he's doing, and he promises he has doctorates from three separate cities. Thinking this man might be crazy, they proceed to the gnome scientist.

The gnome, who introduces himself as Brewster, notices the wear on Moiloc's newly-found items from Haru's forge, and casts Mending to fix them up a bit. Moiloc appreciates this, and tells Brewster the heartbreaking story of how she lost her royal family's armor. The story lasts some time, with Brewster and Branwyn exchanging looks as the story keeps failing to come to an end, and after it finally does, Brewster calls out Moiloc's privilege at the end of the story saying that much of his family was taken as slaves. Moiloc asks if she can help, and Brewster says she likely can't, unless she knows anything about ydril. Brewster also takes notice of Branwyn's ring, and Identifies it as warding magic against fey divination. Moiloc also takes the opportunity to get her red behelit identified, and Brewster is able to Identify it as some sort of key that would respond to a phrase, although what it unlocks he is unable to find.

Brewster asks how Moiloc came about this behelit, and she told the story of [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] leading her to the corpse in the alleys of Montrissad. Brewster recognizes the name Shurima as a country, and questions Moiloc as to what she means. After confirming she is talking about a person named Shurima, he tells her of the story of the country of Shurima, which was located where the Orkus Badlands are now. The country was destroyed about 400-500 years ago by [[Umr-At-Tawil]], who lost his right hand in an unknown context in order to destroy the county.

Through this conversation, Moiloc admits to worshipping Shurima, which takes Branwyn as surprise. Upset by this secrecy and betrayal, Branwyn leaves to the raider's tent. Moiloc and Brewster talk for a little while longer, and Brewster takes interest in her connection to Shurima, making her promise to keep him updated if she encounters Shurima again. Moiloc leaves to chase after Branwyn, but after leaving, hears a jingling from her pack and finds that a wax seal stamp with the Wallachian coat of arms on it. She feels that this may be a gift from Shurima.
## Dunn Raider Tent

When Branwyn enters the raiders' tent, she sees [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] on a large bed. Kaldrake is on one end, with a small amount of space between him and seven closely-huddled raiders. Branwyn cautiously wakes up Kaldrake as Moiloc enters the tent as well. They reel in the realization that the bed Kaldrake has been sleeping in might usually be used for more than just sleeping, and the trio leave the tent to catch up. The three confirm that nobody knows where [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] and [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] are. Branwyn confronts Moiloc on her secrecy about her oath to Shurima, and Moiloc promises that she hasn't killed anyone for Shurima yet. Branwyn presses Moiloc on what Shurima is getting out of this arrangement, and Moiloc admits that she's telling him secrets. She shows the others the wax seal which had appeared in her pack. Branwyn asks if there's anything else Moiloc is keeping, and she admits that she isn't actually a diplomat from her country to strengthen relations with foreign nations, she's actually working to find their vulnerabilities and weaken them, and it seems the racist nation they find themselves in would be a nation that everyone could agree needs to go down anyway.

Kaldrake suggests that the trio just start over to ease the tension, and everyone agrees. Kaldrake and Branwyn re-introduce themselves, but Moiloc does not, and Kaldrake introduces Moiloc to Branwyn for her. The group decide they don't want to go back into the tent, but Kaldrake feels like it wouldn't reflect well on him if the other raiders find he had preferred to sleep outside, so Moiloc and Branwyn set up camp outside the tent and Kaldrake returns to the bed for the night.
# Day 29
## Dunn Raider Tent
The three wake up at about 5:30 in the morning as the raiders are grabbing their armor and weaponry. Kaldrake asks his bedmates what they're doing, and they respond that it's time to raid something. Outside the tent, Gorm is flexing and rousing a crowd of raiders. As the group considers joining the raid for the day, [[Violet]] approaches the group, and Kaldrake introduces her to his companions. Violet says she needs Kaldrake's help, since he could pretend to be an Inquisitor he might be able to help her with another mission that may require some information gathering that would match his skills. She asks that Kaldrake explore the manor, the same manor mentioned in the Adventurer's Guild contract that Moiloc and Branwyn had abandoned. Violet says they'd be considered heroes if they could gather information, which is all Moiloc needs to hear to accept. Violet also tells them to return to the cave and tell Brewster he needs to come as well, since the information they are looking for is related to ydril production.

Kaldrake asks if Violet is coming as well, but she says she is going with Loktar to check out a slave caravan coming from Whitehall. Kaldrake recalls that Whitehall is in Wallachia, and is a city inside of a mountain that contains an entrance to the Underdark, guarded by Monks who are working with the Promised Church. The Monks follow the Wheel, in which each spoke of the wheel represents a plane and step in the evolution of being. They are with the Order of the Flowing Fist, which they remember [[Terren Hammerfist]] mentioning.
## Dunn Laboratory
The trio make their way to recruit Brewster. Kaldrake introduces himself to him, and Brewster mentioned that he had always wanted to go to the Ethereum and recognizes the Sootspot name from the [[Martin Sootspot|head]] of the school. Moiloc shows Brewster the seal she found, and Brewster recognizes the coat of arms as the former House Braeton coat of arms. House Braeton were the rulers of Brasov until about 25 years ago, when they disappeared. Nobody knows why they disappeared or what happened. [[King Endrio the Bold]] was assassinated that year. [[Queen Cypha]] of House Braeton rose to power, and at the time was a follower of the Church, helping them raise to the power they have today, especially the current pontiff, [[Pontiff Sulyvahn]]. The Queen keeps the nobles happy, and justifies the war with the Orkus Badlands. King Endrio used to fight for equal rights, and freed Wallachia from the Orkus Badlands and Amaris.

Learning of Shurima's connection to his home town which led to his enslavement, Brewster is unsure of Moiloc and the group. However, Violet had threatened him before for not following her orders, so he agrees to join the mission. Before leaving, Brewster calls a cauldron with wings, full of some brewed liquid and bearing a large smile, to join them, and introduces the Homunculus as [[Puck Nash|Puck]]. Moiloc and Branwyn fill Kaldrake and Brewster in on what they know about the Chateau from their contract with the Adventurer's Guild, and let Brewster know the Chateau may contain information on ydril production.
## The Chateau - Main Floor
Brewster recognizes a statue of King Endrio on his trusty steed, Boltz, in front of the Chateau as they approach. The building itself looks spooky and dilapidated. Brewster finds it disturbing that there is very little evidence of recent activity from lifeforms of any kind in the area, besides the howling of nearby wolved and occasional evidence of rats. Inside the Chateau, the group sees streaks of blood in the main hall leading to a door in the back of the building. In this hall there are six doors, two on each side and two in the back, and a staircase.

The first room the group enters is a sitting room, filled with pots and taken by overgrowth. Fog is seeping in from outside, and there is a bookshelf filled with rotting books on the wall. Brewster notices one immaculate leather tome marked with the Braeton seal, containing notes about the history of House Braeton. Much of it he already knew, but at the end there are somewhat illegible notes saying that in the year of blood, [[Camilla Braeton]] offered House Braeton to some illegible force, and the entire House was sacrificed except herself and her son, [[Carmine Braeton|Carmine]].

The next room is a dining room, with a dining table split down the middle and the splintered remnants of dining chairs scattered around the room. The table is covered in blood, and beneath the table Branwyn notices a magic circle. Brewster recognizes it as a magic circle used to summon the undead. This room also contains a door to the back room where the blood streaks in the main hall led.

This back room is a kitchen, with no notable blood streaks on the floor, oddly. There's a hatch on the floor, and Kaldrake notices a bucket of milk, placing it on top of the hatch to alert the group if they are being followed by an entity from the basement. Oddly, the milk seems fresh compared to the rotten food in the kitchen. The kitchen also contains a door to the pantry, filled with rotten food, and another door to some sort of butchery, which is absolutely soaked in blood. Branwyn notices this blood is fresh, a few hours old at most, informing the others to be on alert.

Moving on to the final rooms from the main hall, the group continues to a small bedroom. The bed in this room is soaked in blood as well, and there is a rotten corpse on the bead. Kaldrake begins to feel queasy again, but is able to hold it together. Brewster examines the corpse to find an injury to the chest, although if it's a puncture or blunt force, the body is too mangled to tell. The corpse is older, almost rotten, and the body doesn't seem to be staged. There is no other blood in the room besides on the bed around the corpse.

In the next room on the main floor, the group enters to find that the room is immaculately clean, especially in contrast to the rest of the building. In the center of the room is a drawing table with a map of Wallachia, and bookshelves are found on each side wall. There is a book on the drawing table, which Kaldrake opens to find a replica of a portrait of Queen Cypha, with the face torn out. The book itself if a Wallachian history book. Brewster examines the bookshelves, but only finds spell tomes written in Celestial, which nobody is able to translate. These books are also very well-kept.

Finally, the group finds a billiards room in disrepair. Some investigation leads to each member finding some gold. Suspicious that the gold may be cursed or otherwise unwise to take, Kaldrake does not take any.
## The Chateau - Upper Floor
Upstairs the group finds a similar layout in a horseshoe-shaped hall which overlooks the main floor. Once they reach this floor, however, the group seems to disturb a family of bats, which attack.

> [!danger] Fight
> Branwyn seems to have been ready for this, immediately shooting one of the bats and almost taking it down. Brewster hits the bat targeting him with Poison Spray. Puck retaliates against his own bat by attempting to bash himself into it, but misses and flies past. The bat injured by Branwyn joins another bat to attack Kaldrake, but both miss. Another bat targets Moiloc, and sinks its teeth into her. The bat which Puck attacked turns to Brewster but is unable to connect with an attack. The bat which Brewster attacks also takes revenge, biting Brewster. Kaldrake finishes off the bat Branwyn attacked, but Moiloc and Branwyn both miss their bats. Puck rams into the bat which attacked Brewster, and the bat targeting Kaldrake finally gets a bite in as Moiloc's bat scratches her. The two bats near Brewster each are able to scratch him, as Brewster lets down his guard to take out a tool from his pocket and begin to tinker with it. Kaldrake kills the bat which had been attacking him, and Moiloc is almost able to do the same with her own bat. Branwyn again misses, but Brewster is able to get the tool to function, and casts Eldritch Blast at one of the bats targeting him, killing it. Puck rams into the bat which was attacking Moiloc to kill it as well. The remaining bat shrieks, causing the adventurers to reel in pain, but they are all able to shake it off rather quickly as Kaldrake takes the bat down.

Recognizing the danger, Brewster heals himself from the battle, and gives a Potion of Boldness he had prepared to the fighter he recognized as contributing most to the fight, Kaldrake, before the group proceeds to the first room. They decide to save the large doors immediately at the top of the stairs for last.

The first room is locked, but Brewster is able to unlock it. Inside is an armory. Moiloc takes a new set of chainmail armor, and Kaldrake takes a battle axe out of a display case in the back of the room. Branwyn replenishes her supply of arrows.

The next room is not locked, so Kaldrake enters, but the doors slam shut behind him as he hears the hiss of a vampire spawn, who immediately bites him. Kaldrake responds and slashes him multiple times with his new battleaxe, and as the vampire grabs him to finish him off, Kaldrake skewers him with his sword, killing him. Kaldrake notices a shiny silver ring on the spawn's right hand, marked with a one-winged crow, the sigil of House Braeton. The room itself is a bedroom with nothing much of import, also decrepit. Kaldrake leaves the room and gives the ring to Brewster to identify, and he is able to gleam that it is a cursed ring which turns the wearer into a vampire spawn.

The final room on the right hallway is a bedroom for two, absolutely covered with blood. Two feet of a corpse which seems to already be decaying are visible sticking out from under the bed. Kaldrake is able to temper his squeamishness, but as Brewster goes to pull the corpse out, he decides to leave with Moiloc to be safe. Brewster finds that the corpse is impaled with a wooden stake, and also bears a ring similar to the one on the vampire spawn which attacked Kaldrake.

On the other side hall, the first room explored is a storage room, with linens, broken pots, and other standard items to be stored in a manor's closet. Brewster, however, notices a barrel has a false bottom, and takes out a pair of botos and a steel shield. There is also a book, which Brewster finds to be a wizard's spell book. Worried that these items may be cursed in a similar manner to the rings found on the spawns, Brewster investigates the items. The boots are not curse, but seem to bear a magic which he would need to spend time attuning to. The shield is a mithril and steel blend, with no magical qualities except flame resistance. The shield is also brandished with the Braeton sigil.

The next room is a barren bedroom, relatively empty. Branwyn, however, notices a hatch on the roof, and the group ascend to the house's attic, where they again disturb a nest of bats.

> [!danger] Fight
> Kaldrake is unphased, immediately killing one of the bats. Brewster Poison Sprays another, and Puck tries to ram into yet another, missing completely. Two bats turn to Kaldrake, and both are unable to hit. Kaldrake swings back at one but also misses. Two other bats turn to Branwyn and Moiloc, each scratching one, and the bat which Puck missed turns to Puck, and hits him, as Puck deactivates and falls to the ground. The bat which Brewster hit attempts revenge but misses. Branwyn and Moiloc each hit their own attackers, and Kaldrake takes down yet another bat. Brewster misses his attack against his bit, and the remining bat attacking Kaldrake misses, and Kaldrake again misses his riposte. The bat which attacked Puck joins the bat attacking Brewster, but both miss, as does the bat attacking Branwyn, who turns around and takes the bat down. Moiloc hits her own bat, and Kaldrake tags in to finish it off before turning to the bat attacking Moiloc and getting another hit in. Brewster misses his attack on his bat, but Branwyn and Moiloc's bats also miss their attacks. Brewster and Moiloc both get a hit in, Moiloc killing her bat. Kaldrake, turning to help Brewster, also gets a hit in, as does Brewster, but one of the remaining bats begins to shriek. This is enough to kill the other remaining bat, as well as hurt the adventurers, but Branwyn immediately kills it in retaliation.

In the attic, Brewster finds a skeleton the size of a baby, and cloth nearby with a key. The group takes a short rest in the Chateau to recuperate, and Brewster brings Puck back.

Returning to the main building and proceeding to the next room, the adventurers find another bedroom, although the bed is torn from its place on the wall. The room also contains a desk with a decapitated corpse seated at it. Kaldrake notes no signs of a struggle, and recognizes that the corpse was a Braeden noble, and is only about twelve hours old. Moiloc uses Divine Sense, and notes that the final room on the upper floor contains an undead creature.

Moiloc and Kaldrake enter the final room together, and again the doors slam shut behind them. In the room is an ornate bed, from which another vampire spawn rises. The pair notice another ring on the spawn's finger, and Kaldrake finds himself paralyzed.

> [!danger] Fight
> Moiloc attacks the spawn with her flaming sword, and finds fire to be extremely affective. Branwyn chops at the door with her hand axes in attempt to aid the others, to no avail, but Brewster is able to use Eldritch Blast to force the doors open. Puck attempts to charge at the vampire but is unable to make contact before they bite Moiloc. Moiloc is able to use a flaming attack on the vampire again. Branwyn misses a shot at the spawn as Kaldrake is able to break free from his paralysis. Brewster throws another Eldritch Blast at the spawn, and Puck is able to ram into it as well. The spawn reacts with a shriek, hurting Moiloc and Kaldrake, and Brewster and Branwyn to a lesser extent. Moiloc misses her next attack, but Branwyn is able to get a shot in before Kaldrake jumps above the bed, slamming their weapon down on the spawn, killing them.

In the room the group finds a wand of Fireball with a few charges left on it, and a lockbox containing gold, which Kaldrake takes. Moiloc notices a rune etched in blood on the bedframe, and calls Brewster to look at it. He notices that it is a rune of protection, abjuration magic against the void. With nowhere else to go, the group continues to the cellar, noting the milk placed upon the cellar door had not been moved.
## The Chateau - Cellar
Upon entering the cellar, Kaldrake hears the scraping of stone, and alerts the others. The cellar floor is dirt, and in the center the dirt has been recently disturbed. A shovel is still sticking out of this patch of ground, and digging up the disturbed patch reveals a recently dug grave of discarded bones and some rusted weapons. Nearby there is also a corpse with a stake sticking out of its chest. The corpse is fresh, only about an hour old. The stake is a piece of beam which had been ripped out from the building. The corpse is female, with marks of vampire fangs in her neck.

In the back of the room is a pair of doors. Brewster sends Puck in to round the room, but it didn't provoke any action from anything inside. Kaldrake enters the room, and finds what is seemingly a meat locker. In the corner is a stone box emanating a cold fog, and suspended from meat hooks are butchered corpses. An adventurer in leather armor is dead in the corner, not yet hung. Noticing the size of the freezer is much smaller than the connecting wall from the cellar would suggest, Brewster and Kaldrake try the walls that would connect to the space which is unaccounted for, Brewster from the cellar and Kaldrake from the freezer. Brewster finds nothing, but Kaldrake phases through the wall.

Inside is a room with a small window, with a tiny beam of sunlight coming in, and two stone coffins. One coffin is smashed to rubble, and a placard denotes the coffin as being for Camilla Braeton. The other is for Carmine Braeton, and a rod is placed on top of the coffin. Kaldrake notices papers in the coffin which had been reduced to rubble. In these papers are blueprints for an alchemical lab, and although Brewster is unable to determine what these blueprints might mean, he does recognize the Elvish word for ydril. Kaldrake tries opening the other coffin, but its lid won't move, nor will the rod on top of it. Brewster notices a button on the rod, which Kaldrake presses, allowing the immovable rod to be lifted. Moiloc takes the rod, but Kaldrake is still unable to lift the weight of the coffin lid. Moiloc is, however, and as she opens it, the group is thrown back by an explosion of necrotic energy, as a vampiric Carmine rises from the coffin.

> [!danger] Fight
> Branwyn attempts to attack first, but misses her shot. Kaldrake begins strong, hitting Carmine three times, and opening Carmine up for a future attack. Carmine responds by biting Kaldrake, who immediately crumples to the ground. The vampire bite is enough to kill Kaldrake on the spot. Brewster drinks a Potion of Resistance to protect himself in the upcoming battle, and sends Puck to Moiloc. Using Puck as a conduit, Brewster heals Moiloc. Moiloc uses Divine Smite in combination with her flaming sword as a perfect combo against vampires, considerably hurting Carmine, who attempts to retaliate but misses. Branwyn heals herself as Carmine again attempts to attack Moiloc, successfully biting her. Brewster attempts to use Poison Spray on Carmine, but misses, and Carmine again attempts to attack Moiloc, missing as she escapes to drink a healing potion. Again Carmine bites Moiloc, Branwyn attempts to apply a Hunter's Mark to Carmine, but is unable to hit him. Carmine turns to Brewster and bites him, and Brewster retaliates with Poison Spray before Carmine bites him again, downing Brewster. Carmine turns to Moiloc again as she hits him with her fire sword and heals herself. Carmine bites Moiloc again, and as Branwyn makes her way to defend her, Carmine bites Moiloc again, downing her as well.
> 
> Before Branwyn is able to retaliate, Carmine charms Branwyn, causing her to regard Carmine as a friend. Despite this, Branwyn still makes an attempt to save her friends, first helping Moiloc back to her feet. Moiloc hits Carmine once more, but Carmine react by biting Moiloc, and much like Kaldrake, this kills Moiloc. Unable to help Moiloc, Branwyn turns to help Brewster recuperate. Brewster casts Eldritch Blast, causing Carmine to be hurt enough that he is no longer able to float, but Carmine makes his way to Brewster, and downs him again. With nobody else to hurt, Carmine turns to Branwyn, and bites her, which is enough to remove Branwyn from her charmed state as she shoots Carmine point-blank through the neck, killing him.

Branwyn helps Brewster up, and searches Carmine's corpse for anything that could help her friends. On his corpse she finds one scroll of Revivify, and has to choose between bringing back Moiloc or Kaldrake, a difficult decision after the betrayal of trust discovered at the camp with Shurima. Despite this, Branwyn revives Moiloc. The group collects Kaldrake's corpse, Branwyn respecting the dead by wrapping him up. Branwyn makes Brewster promise to not allow Dr. Nubgrub to do anything with Kaldrake, which he accepts. The group weakly makes their way back to Dunn from the manor.
