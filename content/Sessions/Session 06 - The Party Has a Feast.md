### Logline
*As the feast approaches, Kaldrake attempts to gather information on his sister. Lexar is contacted by his cult and confronted with a decision.*
### Synopsis
The adventurers change into the celebration garb in their rooms and split up. Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Branwyn go to the chapel to look for Gwyneth, and are directed to Goro, the blacksmith. Moiloc and Lexar meet some new competitors, and pray, which reveals visions of Moiloc's town being attacked to Moiloc, and an orb to Lexar that leads him to the chapel. Here, he is made to sacrifice someone for his cult. Goro gives Kaldrake a key, which the five notice can be used on the bed in Gwyneth's bedroom to lead them to the potion room. Branwyn learns about Mora, Moiloc learns about the attacks on her city, Lexar learns Gwyneth knows about his cult. The group return to the pre-Game feast, where the guards turn out to be imposters which attack all competitors, and the King, after poisoning them with the feast's dessert. The group barely escapes, and jumps into the outside moat to go to Monty's.
# Day 4
## Castle Barracks
The group heads to their provided room, and find a ceremonial garb that they are expected to wear to the feast. [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] and [[Pine]] are the only ones who decide to follow the dress code; [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] keeps his gauntlets, [[Moiloc Kodlaksdottër|Moiloc]] keeps her hand axe, as does [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], and [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] wears his cult robe over the ceremonial garb. Branwyn and Kaldrake tell the others of [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth's]] portal and what's happening in Martin's Isle. Moiloc seems to like [[David]], and happily tells the others about him. After catching everyone up, the group decide to explore the castle, and to take a stop by the chapel to see if they have any suggestions on how to cure Gertrude of her curse or find Gwyneth.
## Castle Courtyard
Some competitors have left their rooms and returned to the courtyard. There are two dark-skinned humanoid guards training on a collection of training dummies which have been set up. There is a seven-foot [[Man in Black Armor|man in black plate armor]] standing at the castle gate, unmoving. Branwyn feels a recognizable dread from this figure, but is unable to place why. There are also three guards by the entrance to Gwyneth's tower, looking for something, and Kaldrake notes that they are not locals. Branwyn approaches them to see if she may be able to distract them so they can get into the tower and search Gwyneth's room some more. She is able to learn they are other competitors, not guards. Branwyn isn't able to get much more information, however, so she regroups with the others. They decide to go to the chapel to gather information on Gertrude's curse or Gwyneth's whereabouts, but Lexar suggests that it may be best for him, a cult member, to not just waltz in to a religious building unaffiliated with his cult. Lexar and Moiloc stay back to see if they can get more information from the challengers in guard uniforms while the others proceed to the chapel.

The three foreign guards are sparring by the entrance to Gwyneth's tower. One is a [[Contigo|human]] with long blonde hair, a sword, and a scar on their eye, looking to be around 25 years old. Another is a [[Boofoon|half-elf]], younger, around 19 years old, with red hair and a buzz cut, who seems to be arguing with the third competitor, a [[Lortzgab|half-elf]] woman with a burn scar on the left side of her face. Lexar notes the half-orc has no weapons on her. Moiloc jauntily introduces herself to the competitors, perhaps with bad timing, as the half-elf is getting into the half-orc's face, really antagonizing her. The human is more receptive to the introduction, also introducing himself as Contigo. He says the three are from Maedros, and came to town for the Games, but is unable to get more information out as the half-orc slaps the half-elf, causing them to fall to the ground. The human goes to break up the fight, and Lexar gets a chance to talk to the half-orc, who introduces herself as Lortzgab. She implies that they are on some sort of quest or mission as well as the Games. Lexar offers her to a foot race, hoping to clear the entrance to the tower and perhaps allow entry, but she declines.

Moiloc leaves this group and makes her way to the other group of two who are training at the training dummies. She talks to one of them, an orc named [[Dandelon]], who is also from Maedros and part of the same team as Contigo and his group. She isn't able to get much more information, nor is Lexar, so they regroup in the center of the courtyard. Without much more to do, Moiloc prays to [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]], and slips into unconsciousness in her prayer. She is shown a vision of her homeland being attacked by fish men, her father dead, and a village in flames. She jolts back from her state of unconsciousness and begins crying. Lexar tries to console her by telling her it was just a dream, but when she insists it isn't, Lexar doesn’t know how to help with her emotional situation and leaves her to grieve and panic.

Lexar feels compelled to pray as well, seeing Moiloc doing so reminded him he hadn't in a while, and goes to a corner of the courtyard where he wouldn't be seen, faced a wall, and prayed to [[Olidamuru]] for excitement in the Games this year. Upon opening his eyes, he sees a glowing orb of light between him and the wall. The orb begins moving, across the courtyard and to the chapel, and Lexar, remembering the letter which was sent with his grey behelit, follows it immediately.
## Castle Chapel
Moiloc, Branwyn, and Kaldrake arrive at the chapel to see an abyssal priest giving a liturgy over the Inquisitors from the previous night. The chapel worships [[Eru]] the Shaper, a being which is said to have created all races, and often depicted as a robed figure with no face. There is a statue with this depiction in the chapel. This religion is the state religion of Wallachia. Eru also created the Great Old Ones, the antagonistic gods, and the Pantheon of Worship, made up of the protagonist gods. Branwyn also mentions the [[Maokai|Forgotten One]], a god of the wilderness, who was taken prisoner in the war between Gods, and not seen since. All records of the Forgotten One are gone.

The priest himself is an old, bald man. As his liturgy ends and the Inquisitors leave, the three approach him. He is a warm and friendly man, who introduces himself as [[Father Sansor]]. Kaldrake asks about Gwyneth, and Father Sansor informs him she left for home about a week ago. He suggests they visit [[Goro Hattori]], the castle blacksmith and a close friend of Gwyneth, but warns that he is a bit grumpy. The three decide this is a good lead, and leave to meet him.

After they leave, Father Sansor moves to polishing the statue of Eru until Lexar, led by a ball of light, enters the room reluctantly. Lexar introduces himself, saying he felt like he was supposed to come here, and Father Sansor asks for his behelit. After cautiously asking which one, Lexar gives him the grey behelit he was delivered, and Father Sansor puts it into the statue, which gains a face, begins to glow a blinding white, and reveals a staircase leading down. The Father leads Lexar down the stairs, and Lexar hears chants recognizable as religious chants sung by the priests of Olidamuru. As they descend, it gets much hotter, until they reach a barren stone room. Father Sansor gives Lexar a cracked sacrificial dagger to Lexar, with a red gem depicting a screaming skull on its hilt, and motions him to a nearby door. Lexar is still curious about the Father, and asks him his favorite game. His favorite game is chess. Lexar also gets him to admit that he had practiced some of his ominous monologues. In general, Lexar is all for the theatrics.

In the next room is a dungeon, with a figure tied to a torture device. It seems to be an elf or human, but it's hard to tell in the dark. They are a young male. Two priests in grey robes approach Lexar, who asks them for some direction. They do not speak, but motion to the tortured figure, and a voice in Lexar's head tells him to kill him. The knife pulses in Lexar's hand as he raises it over the figure's chest. Lexar asks if his teammates will be safe, and is told by the voice that those who do not get in the way of the cult's actions can be spared. More wanting to see what happens next than following cult orders, Lexar goes through with the sacrifice. The figure's teeth sharpen, as he transforms painfully into a corpse-eater, although Lexar would be unable to recognize this. The priests lead Lexar down a hall, also full of chained corpse-eaters, and to an exit back to the castle grounds.
## Castle Blacksmith
Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Branwyn make their way to the blacksmith. Goro is a dragonborn, very old, with bronze skin, focused on a sword and hammering away. Kaldrake gives a light knock, and calls his name. Goro doesn’t respond, but takes a notice when Kaldrake mentions Gwyneth. He tells Kaldrake Gwyneth did leave for Martin's Isle, and he had finished her order for magic bracelets and had been waiting to give them to her. He gives Kaldrake a key to the office, saying it may help, but Kaldrake recalls they were able to get in earlier just fine with no key. Gertrude chimes in, asking if there is anyone else who could remove her curse, and Goro recommends [[Bartholomew]], a more inexperienced wizard who is taking on some smaller tasks in Gwyneth's absence. While there, Branwyn buys some new armor and Kaldrake gets a longsword. Remembering they didn't ask the priest if he can reverse Gertrude's curse, they head back to the chapel, only to find the door locked.
## Castle Courtyard
Kaldrake, Gertrude, and Branwyn catch up with a crying Moiloc in the courtyard as they attempt to check if Gwyneth's tower is now more easily accessible. A bit after, Lexar also arrives. The others grill him on where he had been, and he lied obviously and said he was getting some snacks before the feast. He also pulls out some pamphlets for his cult, depicting cultists enjoying themselves, pitching the cult as an enjoyable experience of fun and games. The others are suspicious as to why he is pitching this to them now, and recognizes he is a bit shaken up, but don't push too hard and respectfully decline. Lexar says they don't have to pledge their allegiance to the cult, just perhaps not get in their way if they notice anything.

Meanwhile, the half-elf from Contigo's party loudly declares they have been disrespected, and spits on the black plate armored knight by the gate. The knight draws their sword, and the half-elf is dead on the floor immediately. The group takes the distraction as an opportunity to enter Gwyneth's tower.
## Gwyneth's Tower
In the tower, Kaldrake finds a false bottom in one of the drawers to the desk, in which is a book: Gwyneth's diary. Not wanting to pry too much into her sister's private matters, she just looks at the most recent entry, from three days ago. In this entry Gwyneth states she is about to head home, and mentions the drow attacking Martin's Isle, but again, it is filled with technical info that Kaldrake does not understand. He sends a fantasy text to his fantasy mom on his fantasy phone about it, but she didn't really know either.

Branwyn finds a book entitled "On [[Mora]]," by Gwyneth, documenting sixty years of info on Mora. However, it's written in a code, and Lexar comments it looks like a recipe when trying to help decode it. Giving up on the book, Branwyn and Lexar ascend the ladder in the office to Gwyneth's bedroom, and notice a keyhole on her bedframe. Branwyn calls up Kaldrake to use his key from Goro, and he and Gertrude come up to inspect the keyhole. Upon inserting the key, Kaldrake and Gertrude find the bed ascending into the ceiling of the room, bringing them into a potion room. Gertrude lights a candle. There is a book on the workbench of the potion room, and Gertrude looks through in hope of finding a way to remove her curse both in the book and on the shelves of potion. She doesn't find anything, but is able to collect eight healing potions.

Kaldrake looks into the book to find it is full of experiment logs. There is one on avoiding possession, with another recipe-looking cipher circled. Kaldrake rips this page out, and finds that the ingredients should be easy to find if it is indeed a recipe. Gertrude continues looking for potions, and sniffs a vibrant green one, which burns her nostrils. She decides to keep the acidic potion for later.

Back in the study, Lexar finds a book on his cult, and finally is able to confirm that it was Gwyneth who sent him the orders to protect Kaldrake. She seems to know about the corpse-eaters, although Lexar still doesn't have enough information to fully make the connection, but Lexar still doesn't know why he specifically was chosen to protect Kaldrake. Moiloc finds a book on the Sahuagin, the fish people who are attacking her homeland. They worship [[Sekolah]], a shark God. Moiloc had heard of them, but they aren't known for major attacks, and tend to mostly fight among themselves, so it's odd that they're united enough to attack her home. The others return from the bedroom, and Gertrude gives everyone one potion, and Branwyn, Kaldrake, and herself an extra. Branwyn asks if anyone else can decode the book on Mora, and vaguely eludes to their relationship. With no new ideas, the group descend the tower, as it is almost time for the feast.
## Castle Dining Hall
On their way to the dining hall, the group sees the aftermath of the fight between the half-elf and black knight. Royal guards are holding back Contigo and Lortzgab, who are trying to avenge their teammate. It is overheard that the dead half-elf's name was Boofoon. The servants unlock the dining hall, and the feast begins.

The tables in the dining hall are each masterfully carved out of what appears to be a single log each. At the end of the hall, [[King Aslan]] is seated with four of his advisors, although the Queen's seat is empty. Gertrude tries to seduce the King by staring intently at him, but he is too deep in conversation with his advisors to notice, but while staring Gertrude notices the king has two right hands. She brings this up to Kaldrake, and it sounds familiar to him, beings with two hands, but he can't place it.

The Inquisitors are seated at the table closest to Aslan, with [[Rynn|Rynn's]] group sat opposite of them. David's room is at a circular table at the corner opposite the King, and he is noticeably shaken. Lexar makes his way to him, and pitches his cult to David again to try and ensure his safety after what happened in the chapel. David mentions that he saw Boofoon die. His team is also shaken, and one farmhand who was originally with him is not at the feast. Lexar returns to his team's table, sat opposite David's.

A group of misfits led by a kobold wearing a dead boar's head as a hat enter the dining hall, soon followed by the black knight. All in all, there are eight teams including the Roosevelts, and about 34 competitors overall. There are six guards positioned behind the king, and about eight more positioned around the walls of the dining hall. The servants serve the food once all guests have arrived, and it seems to fit everyone's tastes: Moiloc has fish, Branwyn a simple vegetarian meal, Pine gets some ground meat, Kaldrake gets fine bread, Lexar gets lizards on a stick. They are also given a fine wine, as Aslan stands to give a speech, congratulating everyone on reaching the final stage of the Games, telling them to enjoy the banquet before the rules are revealed for the last round. After this, apple pie is brought out as desert for the competitors to enjoy.

Soon after eating it, everyone begins feeling nauseous, either being very hurt by the food or passing out altogether. Lexar passes out on the table, as does the black knight, Aslan's advisors, and all of David's farmhands. David pulls out a hammer in defense as all of the guards around the hall take out their swords and begin attacking the competitors.

> [!danger] Fight
> Branwyn comes to action immediately, attacking the guard by the west door with both of her axes, but the guard deflects both attacks with his sword. Kaldrake attacks this guard as well with his new longsword, but also is blocked. The guard positioned nearby the guard they are attacking retaliates, missing Kaldrake and giving him an opportunity to riposte and strike back, successfully. The first guard also attacks Kaldrake, and is unable to land his hit.
> 
> The guard by the south door comes to Gertrude, taking her down with one slash his sword. Moiloc defends Gertrude from a second incoming attack from a guard by the south table, and heals Gertrude enough for her to stand again. Gertrude takes the opportunity to throw her acidic potion at the guard who took her down, but some of it spills to Moiloc and Gertrude as well, burning all three in the puddle of acid on the ground. Branwyn returns to the guard she originally attacked, and is able to hit him, and Kaldrake is able to hit the other nearby guard as well.
> 
> Meanwhile, one of the still-standing Inquisitors is able to take down a guard, but is immediately killed by another. King Aslan is able to kill one of the guards behind him, and escape unscathed from the others closing in on him, for now. Back to the main group, Branwyn is flanked by the the guard she was attacking and one approaching from the south, who both attack her. Branwyn falls to the ground, dying. Kaldrake's guard misses him, Kaldrake misses his riposte, and Moiloc's guard misses her and is burnt by the acid. Moiloc gets out of the acid puddle, dodging another attack from the guard as she steps away. Gertrude uses Shillelagh, but misses, and leaves the acid, trying to make her way to Lexar to try and pull him out of the building.
> 
> A guard takes down another Inquisitor, but Aslan kills the guard soon after. Kaldrake hits one of the nearby guards, but all three nearby are now focused on him, and attack. After the second attack, Kaldrake is also taken down. The guard in the acid finally dies, melting. Moiloc misses the other guard nearby her and Gertrude, and Gertrude casts Pass Without Trace, possibly allowing the team to escape more easily, as the fight is not going well. She drags Lexar to the window, casts Shillelagh on it, shatters it, and Gertrude and Lexar escape the dining hall.
> 
> Aslan notices one of the guards has killed a competitor on Rynn's team, and makes his way over there to attack. He is struggling with his battle wounds, blood running down his arm. With Kaldrake and Branwyn down, and Gertrude having escaped, all the guards attack Moiloc. Moiloc attempts to retaliate, but misses badly and stumbles to the ground. Branwyn, still conscious, drinks one of the health potions Gertrude gave her, and gets up. Branwyn sneaks out of the dining hall as well. The guards don't notice, and all of them attack a prone Moiloc again, taking her down. Kaldrake notices Branwyn and does the same as her, leaving the hall unnoticed. Aslan is very hurt, but kills the guard by Rynn. Aslan's arm is basically useless now, and he drops his sword, as the guards who had attacked Moiloc turn toward him. After a moment, Aslan is able to use the last of his strength to kill the remaining guards. Moiloc, downed and hurt, using her healing potion form Gertrude. She tries to get David's attention to take him with her, but he is too scared stiff to notice. Aslan locks eyes with Moiloc after killing the last of the guards, and falls to the ground, out of strength.

Moiloc hears the stomping of armored feet coming to the room. Unable to get David's attention, she leaves before more danger arrives, not knowing how many enemies are approaching.
## The Castle Grounds
Gertrude and Lexar notice the outside is in a panic, the real guards are struggling to hold their ground, and some guards, adventurers, or other castle workers are being dragged away by the attackers. With Gertrude's spell still in effect, they are able to make it to Gwyneth's tower without being noticed.

When Branwyn and Kaldrake leave the dining hall, separately, they consider going back to their barracks for their remaining items, but as it is on the opposite corner of the castle and the grounds are too dangerous, they both also individually decide to go to the castle, which they are able to safely do under Gertrude's spell.

Moiloc leaves last, and although she wanted to save King Aslan, recognizes she had to leave. The guards were much closer by the time she makes it out, and Moiloc sees two attackers running up the stairs to Gwyneth's tower. Realizing the tower is no longer an option, she looks for other methods of escape. She sees two competitors going into the buttery nearby, and follows them in.
## Gwyneth's Tower
Lortzgab and Contigo are already in the tower when Lexar and Gertrude arrives. Lexar eventually comes to in Gwyneth's tower. Seeing Lortzgab, he comments that it seems she beat him in the foot race she declined. Looking for a method of escape and barricading the door after Kaldrake and Branwyn arrive, the six of them discuss possibilities. Gertrude looks out the window to the courtyard to see corpse-eaters tearing apart people in the courtyard, although she does not recognize them as such, and Lexar is too weak to look out the window and recognize them either. The group decides to use the bed to get to the potions room, and two by two make it up on the small elevator, after taking the mattress off the bed and using it to barricade the trap door.

In the potions room, Lortzgab reveals she is a wizard, and says she can cast Feather Falling to allow everyone to jump, since the potion room window is outward-facing they can jump to the moat. She does try to do so, but only Kaldrake is within the spell's effect, and the others splash into the moat a bit more forcefully. All six are able to get to the moat's bank, and Kaldrake, Lexar, Branwyn, and Gertrude decide to go to [[Monty MacMasters|Monty's]]. Lortzgab and Contigo follow, not having anywhere else to go.
## The Buttery
Moiloc finds that the two challengers are a [[Terren Hammerfist|hurt dwarf]] and [[Belnades|one of the Inquisitors]]. She whispers that she is also trying to escape and comes in peace, and the dwarf basically yells at her to stay quiet. The Inquisitor motions her over, and they leave to the outer wall through a small hole, and begin taking off their armor to jump into the moat. Moiloc is upset about losing her armor, as it's important to her, but with no other option she takes note of where she left her armor and jumps after them. Moiloc immediately darts to Monty's, and the other two competitors, confused, follow.
