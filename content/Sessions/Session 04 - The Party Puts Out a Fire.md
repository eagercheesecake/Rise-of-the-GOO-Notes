### Logline
*Kaldrake, Moiloc, Branwyn, and Gertrude find themselves in danger when the Hatched Pig Inn is attacked. Lexar has a restless night.*
### Summary
Moiloc, Branwyn, Gertrude, and Kaldrake are attacked in the night by thieves who are burning the building down. They are able to fend them off and escape with Jim, but are split up. Kaldrake and Pine follow a thief to a warehouse, where he finds out they are corpse eaters who are collecting hearts. Gertrude is able to gather townsfolk and put out the fire, but in conversing with the other citizens finds that some information is being magically silenced in some way. Jim takes Moiloc and Branwyn to Monty, who turns out to be Jim's brother. Moiloc and Monty strike a deal where Monty gets to speak to Moiloc's father in exchange for supporting her in the Games. Monty gives them payment and a room, and sends Lexar a vaguely threatening letter. Once Lexar, Gertrude, and Kaldrake realize their friends are safe, they return to Lexar's house for the night.
# Day 3
## The Hatched Pig Inn

[[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] takes the seal that he and [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] got with him back home, and the other remains at the Hatched Pig's Inn. This was to prevent both seals being taken in the event that someone acts on [[Moiloc Kodlaksdottër|Moiloc]], [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]], and [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake's]] public victory, so that both seals wouldn't be in danger. In case something happens, Lexar gives the others his address as an alternate place to meet up.

Moiloc wakes up to a sharp pain, and reaches over to the sensation to remove a dart. She sees standing nearby a hooded figure with a metal item. The thief retaliates after seeing Moiloc pull the dart out, but misses with his dagger. Moiloc ignites her magic sword, and notices yellow eyes on her attacker before warning them to leave. Frightened, the thief leaves. Moiloc sends a shot after him as he darts away, but also misses.

After seeing Gertrude is coming to, Moiloc gives chase to the thief. Gertrude removes her own dart from herself and goes to check on [[Pine]], removing his dart as well. Soon after, she smells burning, grabs Pine, and leaves, seeing Kaldrake and Branwyn running down the stairs before her.

While this all was happening, Branwyn wakes up to her own dart and attacker, and is also able to resist the paralysis and remove the dart. With her dark vision, she can see large pointed ears on the attacker. Branwyn is able to hit the thief first with one of her axes, and the pair begin fighting, both dodging each other's attacks for a while. Finally, Branwyn decides to try out her Ensnaring Strike ability. The thief is able to dodge the first time, but is trapped by the thorny vines the second time.

Branwyn attempts to ask the thief who sent them, but it appears they don’t understand Common. Branwyn tries asking again in Elvish, which does seem to evoke some sort of reaction of understanding, but blood loss from the vines gets to the thief before Branwyn can receive her answer. She checks the corpse, only finding darts, a blowgun, and a knife. Branwyn leaves to check up on the others, first checking on Kaldrake. After knocking on his door, Branwyn is surprised to see a rather bloody Kaldrake greet her, and a very mangled corpse on the floor.

While the others were fighting their thieves, Kaldrake is greeted by one of his own. Unlike the others, however, Kaldrake is unable to remove the dart and paralysis takes place. The thief is able to get a few stabs in before the shock of the pain lets Kaldrake break his paralysis. Now, with Kaldrake's ability to move, the thief is unable to get another attack off with Kaldrake's armor, although the attacks he had been able to make so far has left Kaldrake in very bad shape.

Kaldrake gets out his morning star, and begins swinging at the thief, who is able to dodge for a while. On his fourth attempt, Kaldrake is able to hit the thief, making him fall to the floor and lose a bit of mobility, but the thief also gets one more slash at Kaldrake on his way down. Kaldrake retaliates with one final blow with his morning star, completely destroying the point of impact, and leaving a pale, bloodied, near unrecognizable corpse. Exhausted and hurt, Kaldrake goes back to bed for a short moment before hearing Branwyn knocking at his door. After the two meet up, they, too, smell burning, and decide to go downstairs.

Moiloc is first to arrive downstairs at the tavern of the inn, and sees that the front of the tavern is on fire. Also in the tavern is five thieves, who notice Moiloc and begin alerting each other in Elvish. One throws a dagger at Moiloc, who responds by telling them that they should fight later since the inn seems to be burning down. The other thieves respond by pulling out their own daggers.

> [!danger] Fight
> Branwyn and Kaldrake are next to reach the tavern, and Branwyn makes an attempt on her way downstairs to alert the other patrons by yelling that there is a fire. The pair reach downstairs as Moiloc is attacking the thief who threw the first dagger with her sword. Branwyn sees another thief on the far end of the tavern who is attempting to approach the stairs, and fires a bolt at them, but misses. Kaldrake, meanwhile, uses his morning star to attack the thief coming from the stairs' left, causing the thief to lose the use of his arm.
> 
> The thief that initially attacked Moiloc attacks again, missing, as another thief positioned behind the bar jumps on top of the countertop and stabs Branwyn. Branwyn hits him back with her hatchet as Gertrude arrives at the tavern. Gertrude notices a thief coming up from behind Branwyn, and is able to get a quick hit in, getting his attention. The one-armed thief attacks Kaldrake back, which really takes him down after being bloodied from the battle in his room. Gertrude notices this, and heals him.
> 
> The thief on the bar gets another stab in on Branwyn, who is having trouble hitting back. Luckily, from behind the thief, a bloodied [[Jim MacMasters|Jim]] rises, and knocks out the thief with a mug from behind the bar. Kaldrake is able to take down the one-armed thief, but, noticing that they are outnumbered, begins to make his way toward the fire to see if he can find an exit for retreat. Moiloc is able to take down her thief soon after the second thief reaches her, and Branwyn turns to help Gertrude with her fight.

Kaldrake is able to break a window, and motions the others to follow him out. Jim slumps down, unconscious, worn out from the attack, and Branwyn and Gertrude go to help him after Gertrude takes down the thief attacking her. Branwyn helps him up after Gertrude heals him. Jim apologizes for the thieves, claiming they are business competition, and tells Branwyn to pull the third tap behind the bar. As Moiloc decapitates one of the two remaining thieves, Branwyn pulls the tap, and a wall at the end of the bar opens up to reveal a staircase. Moiloc is hit by the final thief, but is able to kill him with the help of Gertrude's fire ability.

Kaldrake leaves through the broken window before the fire overtakes it, and Gertrude, wanting to keep Pine safe, has Kaldrake take Pine with him. Those still in the tavern discuss for a moment, as Jim hobbles down the staircase. Gertrude decides to also leave through the window, and Moiloc and Branwyn follow Jim. Kaldrake sees some thieves going down an alley with a sack, and decides to take Pine and follow them. Gertrude makes it out of the inn, and finds it odd that she sees nobody: no guards, no inn patrons, no Kaldrake, no Pine. It is the middle of the night, so the guards don't concern her too much, but Gertrude is concerned about not seeing any survivors from the inn. Using her skywriting ability, she writes "Fire, nobody leaving inn, no guards either. Suspicious! Sincerely, Gertrude." This is able to attract some attention from nearby civilians and a few guards, and those who were awakened by the fire come to help put it out.
## Alleyway
Kaldrake and Pine follow the thief down an alley and into a warehouse. Upon entering, Kaldrake does not see the thief, but does notice many burlap sacks in the entrance room. Looking into one, she sees it is full of freshly harvested hearts. She is disgusted by this and recoils, but collects herself and opens a second bag to confirm it contains the same - and it does. Noticing a door in the room, Kaldrake proceeds deeper into the warehouse, and upon entering the next room sees three thieves on a table. Their hoods and masks are removed, revealing dark green skin and sharp teeth as they feast on a person viscerally. Kaldrake, having had enough, leaves the warehouse and retreats back to the alley, being sure to position herself to block Pine from also seeing these horrific sights. Kaldrake sits himself down in the alley, and pets Pine for a while in shock. After a moment, he sees Gertrude's message, but wishes it were more helpful to his current predicament. He's so distraught he doesn't even notice his fantasy mom sending him a fantasy text on his fantasy phone with a cute cat picture. After many more minutes pass of Kaldrake processing what he had seen, he decides he needs to rest for the night, and goes to Lexar's house with the address he gave her the previous night.
## Secret Bar Passage
Jim takes a lantern off the wall near the entrance to the secret staircase and leads Branwyn and Moiloc down a long stairwell. Noticing Jim is still very cut up and actively bleeding, Moiloc offers to heal him. As she does so, Jim reveals his side of the story: about 30 thieves entered the bar as they set the inn aflame before some rushed upstairs. Soon after, the four adventurers at the inn came down, but Jim saw nobody else leave. He was, however, hiding behind the bar for a portion of the fight. Moiloc suggests that Jim may need further medical attention, and Jim says [[Monty MacMasters|Monty]] will be able to provide. Moiloc probes on this, not knowing who Monty is, and Branwyn explains her connection to him. She makes it clear that she doesn't totally trust him, and that he is a somewhat shady figure.

After walking a bit in the hall, the three enter the hallway which Branwyn recognizes as the long hallway in the back of Monty's shop, the hall that leads to the treasure room. However, the doors in the hall seem to have shifted since her last visit, and some doors are missing or new additions. Moiloc is trying to do some icebreakers with Jim as a fun way for the group to get to know each other, but Jim is not in the mood and outright ignores her. Jim leads the pair to Monty's office, where he opens a drawer on Monty's desk and drinks a potion from inside. Monty is noticeably absent from the office. Jim looks much better after the potion, and reveals to the others the rest of the story: Jim is Monty's brother, and the thieves were likely part of a group that Monty and Jim have made enemies with along the way.

Branwyn tries to take a look around the room nonchalantly to gain info on Monty, but finds herself charmed by a red gem in a display case. Jim notices this, and chucks a paperweight at her, snapping her out of it, much to her discontent. She tries to take another glimpse at the gem, but upon feeling pulled in again, shakes it off and looks away. Jim says the gem is used in some of Monty's "negotiations" in his business talks to sway the other side. Branwyn asks where Monty is, and Jim points them to a door connected to the office.

In Monty's room are many pillars, display cases, hunting trophies (notably a large dragon head), and many other artifacts and treasures. Monty emerges from his sleep, he is wearing a nightcap and nightgown, and calls out to Branwyn, asking why she's there at three in the morning. Branwyn explains, but Monty just seems to react as if it is part of a string of attacks. Noting the inn may be destroyed, he realizes it will not be good for his financials, and begins journaling in a nearby book, crunching numbers. He is snapped out of it as Moiloc approaches, as Monty sees her royal garb and asks straight out if she is wealthy. Upon confirming, Monty and Moiloc have the heartiest handshake known to man, and Monty does a bow culturally tied to the Kodlak Islands. He voices his discontent with how the Kodlak Islands were treated by his country. A touching sentiment, immediately followed by a rant on how the import tax from the Kodlak Islands is very upsetting, and that dwarves should just rise up and rule instead to allow better business practices.

Moiloc suggests a proposition to Monty, who notes it's perhaps not the best time for him given the situation and time of night, but ends up commending Moiloc for making a deal while she has the upper hand over her opponent. Monty pours Moiloc a drink, the strongest drink she has ever tasted, but by Monty's reaction it seemed he was used to it. Before negotiations begin, Branwyn pulls Moiloc away, repeating that she doesn't trust Monty and it may not be a good idea to enter into a deal with him. Upon the negotiation's resuming, Monty states he wants an in to a conversation with Moiloc's father. Moiloc notes Branwyn's concerns, and makes sure to make Monty promise that he is a friend and won't hurt her nation. He does, Moiloc takes him at his word, and they shake on it, much to Branwyn's disapproval. With the inn burnt down, Monty gives Moiloc and Branwyn 100 gold pieces each and a room in his shop as compensation for his winnings from betting on them in the Melee. Monty also sends for Kaldrake and Gertrude per Moiloc's request before asking for privacy and opening a chest of glass shards. Neither Branwyn nor Moiloc recognize the shards as part of any magic they know, but then again, Moiloc does not know magic.
## The Hatched Pig Inn
Gertrude and the other civilians are able to put out the fire. Gertrude asks a guard if he has any information, and the guard replies by saying it was likely a grease fire. Some older residents nearby tell Gertrude it happens every time the Games are put on to some inn or another, and that the Hatched Pig Inn is only about 15 years old. One resident had seen four burnt inns in her time in Montrissad.

Upon trying to gather more information, however, Gertrude notices the citizens have cold, dead eyes. In an attempt to check if they are alive, Gertrude shakes another citizen's hand in introduction, noting it is still warm. She asks the citizen their name, but as they attempt to respond, their name is inaudible, replaced by a silence. Gertrude asks again to the same affect. Probing a bit, Gertrude learns the citizen was a part of the Amaris Games, but didn't make it far. Realizing she has no place to stay, Gertrude asks if she can crash on the citizen's couch. He says no, but Gertrude remembers that Lexar had given her his address the previous night.
## Lexar's House
Lexar has been having a long night. His neighbors have been rather loud in celebration of the Games, and it was keeping him up. Kaldrake is the first to arrive, knocking at the door. Lexar, trying to get some sleep and thinking it's his neighbors, ignores it. Kaldrake yells that he has Pine, which is enough to get Lexar to answer the door. Both are tired, Lexar explains his night, Kaldrake would rather not explain his, and after Lexar makes Kaldrake promise to keep Pine from going to the bathroom on his floors, they both start going to bed.

Before Lexar is even able to get into bed, Gertrude arrives, loudly knocking on the door. Kaldrake and Lexar silently motion to each other to stay quiet to keep her from noticing, and Lexar takes a peek out the window to see who it is. Gertrude notices the curtains move, and loudly knocks again, announcing that she saw him in the window. Lexar opens the door, and Gertrude beelines to his bed, taking up all of it despite Lexar's protests and attempts to stop her, only saying that the inn burnt down before falling asleep. Lexar tries to remove her from the bed so he can finally get some sleep, but is again interrupted by another knock at the door. It's a little orphan boy, one of Monty's helpers, delivering the message from Monty, which reads "I have your friends, come to Monty the Magnificent's House of Miracles if you want to see them again." This riles up the trio, and they go to Monty's shop as fast as possible. Kaldrake has to carry Gertrude because she is slower and running behind.

On the way, Gertrude tries to tell the others of the odd censoring she noticed with the citizens, but found herself somehow unable to remember the interactions at all. Once reaching the shops, they find it is not open and the door is locked. They use Gertrude's frankly impressive ability to knock on doors to attract Monty's attention. Monty answers the door, and tells them that their friends are safe and he technically didn't lie. He doesn't appreciate the hostility that follows and slams the door. Realizing their friends are safe, Lexar and Kaldrake sprint back to Lexar's house as Gertrude slowly hobbles behind so they can get some sleep before Gertrude catches up and arrives at the house.
