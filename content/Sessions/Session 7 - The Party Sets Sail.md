### Logline
*The group makes their way out of Montrissad, meeting some new friends on the journey. Lexar and Kaldrake get taken in by the church. Moiloc, Gertrude, and Branwyn explore the town to replenish what they had lost.*
### Synopsis
Montrissad is being overtaken by corpse eaters and other monsters. Branwyn rescues a young girl, Charlotte. The adventurers make their way to Monty's, only to find him and his back rooms gone. A teleporter in a nearby apothecary helps the group get to the docks, where Goro, having rescued David and Aslan, takes the group to his ship. On the ship the group meets Skalazar, who had been stowing away in the lower decks. The ship makes its way to Brasov in Wallachia to hopefully reunite with Monty and replace the weapons and armors they had lost. Lexar and Kaldrake are taken to the monastery, where they are attempted to be recruited by the inquisitors. Branwyn, Moiloc, Gertrude, Contigo, and Lortzgab go to the Adventurer's Guild and take on a quest to become members of the Guild.
# Day 4
## Castle Outskirts
[[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]], [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], [[Contigo]], and [[Lortzgab]] get to the shore of the moat. Screams can be heard from the city proper, implying the attacks were not isolated to the castle. Above them, they notice the moon is a pale orange, and seems to be bigger than usual. Branwyn casts Cure Wounds on herself to recuperate from the attack in the dining hall. The group is in a small patch of trees surrounding the moat, and have to get through a thick row of buildings to get into the city. Kaldrake points out a nearby alley which the team may be able to use to get to [[Monty MacMasters|Monty's]] a bit faster, but also notices three soggy figures in the moat nearby.

Unknown to them, these soggy figures are [[Moiloc Kodlaksdottër|Moiloc]] and her two companions. Moiloc notices an open window at the back of one of the nearby houses and begins to run toward it, the other two also following. The other group notices the figures sprinting at them. Thinking the soggy figures may be enemies, they run away toward the nearby alley.
## Streets of Montrissad
Once passing through the alley and making it to the streets, the group sees a group of townsfolk and guards attempting to barricade off the street opposite the direction to Monty's. There are corpse-eaters attempting to make their way through the barricade, and a few occasionally manage to get through. Branwyn notices a young, blonde, [[Charlotte|half-elf girl]] standing by a corpse. She rushes over to grab her, as a nearby guard stabs a corpse-eater and knocks it aside. The guards are clearly winded, they may not hold much longer. Branwyn brings the girl back, asking her name. The girl introduces herself as Charlotte. Branwyn regroups with the others and they continue on their way to Monty's.

Meanwhile, Moiloc and the others get into the house through the window. The house's front door is immediately behind the barricade, but a couple corpse-eaters that had made their way through are right outside. Moiloc convenes with her two new companions, who introduce themselves. The dwarf is [[Terren Hammerfist]] and the Inquisitor goes by [[Belnades]]. One of the corpse-eaters is bleeding pretty badly, likely the one the guard pushed back before, but the other is still unharmed.

> [!danger] Fight
> Moiloc lops off the leg of the second one with her fire longsword, but the corpse-eater survives and lunges at her. It misses, but the other one takes advantage of the distraction to bite, poisoning Moiloc. Moiloc retreats back into the house, still hurt from the previous fight, and asks Belnades to heal her. She does so, but comments that she's still learning so it may not be as effective. Moiloc goes back to the door, decapitating one corpse-eater. The other slashes at Moiloc, who is now dripping blood and in bad shape. Moiloc is able to kill the other corpse-eater, and call the others to follow her down the street.

Lexar, Gertrude, Branwyn, Kaldrake, and their companions continue on their way to Monty, but upon reaching Mulligan Street, which rings a bell to the adventurers but they are unable to place, they see a bloody scene at the main intersection. There is the sound of metal on metal as guards fight back a corpse golem, a bloody humanoid-shaped mass of viscera holding a blood-soaked brick on a chain. There are three guards attacking it, but all seem hurt. The group also notices a woman nearby, hiding from the golem under a pile of corpses. One of the guards notices the group and calls to Gertrude for help.

> [!danger] Fight
> Gertrude uses Hold Person to keep the golem still while the guards attack, and a few of them are finally able to get hits in. The golem breaks free pretty immediately, but Lexar uses Dissonant Whispers, and the golem runs away a few feet. He immediately comes back and, realizing they may not be able to beat this fight, the group uses the opportunity with the golem pushed back to continue down the street toward Monty's.

Moiloc gets to the intersection soon after, and sees the corpse golem smash one of the guards into a building. Her group also decides they cannot take this monster and leaves.

The larger group gets to Monty's, but sees smoke billowing from the windows. They enter, and see a small fire on the counter. Lexar is able to put it out with his magic, but Branwyn realizes the door that led downstairs to Monty's hall is missing. She notices a powder forming runes around where the door once was, and a dent in the center of the wall. She takes some of the powder, smudges it into the dent, and a mailbox-sized hole opens, throwing a paper onto the ground. It's a letter from Monty, saying he has left Montrissad, and to meet him in Brasov, Wallachia if they wish to meet up with him. Lexar and Gertrude, knowing a bit about magic, are able to recognize that the hallway has moved, and wasn't just blocked off, so there was no hope of getting to Monty's hall for shelter as they had planned. Branwyn looks out the doorway to Monty's shop for some sort of apothecary to help with the party's massive wounds, and manages to find one. On their way to the apothecary, Moiloc's group reaches Monty's and is able to meet up with the others.
## Bartholomew's Apothecary
In the center of the apothecary is a large circle of runes, and the furniture in the room has been pushed aside to allow room for it. The group is able to find some potions in the apothecary, and passes them out among each other. Kaldrake and Branwyn head upstairs to see if they can find any information on the circle. They find some jewelry in a lockbox Branwyn is able to break open, and pass it out among the group, but also find a note saying the circle is a teleportation circle which has not been tested and should not be used.

The magic users in the group collectively are able to understand the teleportation circle. The group would need to teleport somewhere they have all been. After some discussion about whether or not to use the risky teleporter at all, the group decides their best course of action is to make it to the docks and leave Montrissad. Not wanting to pass by the golem again, the group agrees to use the teleporter. Lexar and some of the others had not been outside the city, so the docks was the only place they had all been. They focus on this location, and the teleporter manages to get them pretty close.
## Docks
The ten reappear sprawled about the floor of a house. Gertrude looks out the back window and is able to identify that they are in some of the houses closest to the docks, but sees carnage outside. The docks were everyone's first choice, and the corpse-eaters have beaten them there. While discussing a course of action, Monty's orphans are considered to possibly know where he is. Kaldrake asks Charlotte if she is an orphan, and learns that her dad was the corpse she was found by when Branwyn picked her up. Charlotte cries, so Kaldrake gives her the necklace he got from the lockbox in the apothecary. Terren speaks up, saying he would still like to see if it is possible to get a boat.

Moiloc goes out the back window to a small alley surrounded by houses. On the other end of the alley are screams and corpse-eaters, so she tries to stay quiet and get a read on the situation. Everyone outside seems to be overwhelmed by corpse-eaters, and Moiloc is able to sense the corpse-eaters in overwhelming numbers. Branwyn sees a sewer grate in the alley, and suggests they could use it to get to the drainage tunnel that will likely let out under the docks. Moiloc immediately descends, and the others follow.

The sewer reeks of decay and viscera that have come in through the city drains from the carnage outside. Kaldrake is able to pry away some grating with her bare hands, allowing the group to progress toward the drainage tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, Gertrude notices a faint light, and is able to identify [[Goro Hattori|Goro]] holding a torch, with [[King Aslan]] and [[David]] in tow. King Aslan is unconscious, and David is still unresponsive. Gertrude makes an attempt to heal King Aslan, but he doesn’t awaken.

The door leading out of the sewers is locked by a padlock. Moiloc attempts to use her fire longsword to melt it or otherwise break it off, but is unsuccessful. David still has the hammer he was wielding from the fight in the dining hall, and Goro takes it and smashes the lock, allowing the group to exit. Kaldrake notices that Aslan still has two right hands, but Goro doesn't seem to pay any mind to it.

Goro points out a nearby boat, saying it's his personal ship: a trabaccolo. The group exits the sewers to find themselves below the pier, and are able to sneak to a nearby ladder and board the ship without being noticed by the corpse eaters. The sails are let down, and Goro begins to steer the boat away from the carnage.
## Wavecrasher
After sailing out a bit, Goro drops the anchor, and calls all responsive people to the captain's room to discuss next steps. The sleeping barracks can hold fourteen, and Branwyn decides to put the meeting on hold momentarily to get Charlotte to sleep after her big day. On their way to the barracks, however, Branwyn hears scurrying and leaves. She warns the others in the captain's room, and Goro grabs a nearby sword and leads the descent into the barracks.

Goro calls out into the room, asking the hidden figure to show themselves. A [[Skalazar|humanoid gecko]] in dirtied robes appears, pleading Goro not to hurt him. Moiloc immediately introduces herself, and the gecko introduces himself as well, saying his name is Skalazar. He had been sleeping in the lower decks when the corpse eater invasion began. Goro does not like stowaways, but with no other options, lets Skalazar stay until they next dock. Goro tells Skalazar to put himself to use in the crow's nest, and the others return to the captain's quarters. Contigo takes Charlotte to the main deck, deciding she should sleep after the group makes their plans.

Goro mentions that they only have four to six weeks of supplies for a group of this size. He plans to take Aslan to safety, but doesn't mind where that would be. Gertrude notices a yellow aura around King Aslan, and tells the others the king may be under some sort of necromancy spell.

Brasov seems a clear first stop based on Monty's letter, he may at least be able to help get the team their weapons back after losing so much in the castle. Brasov is about three weeks away by ship, so the group has the resources for it. Until then, the group splits into shifts to man the ship. Kaldrake, Gertrude, Branwyn, Goro, Belnades, and Charlotte will take the day shift, while Moiloc, Lexar, Terren, Contigo, Skalazar, and Lortzgab will take the night shift. David and Aslan are clearly unable to assist.

The next day, Branwyn approaches Goro, asking if he will take her on as an apprentice. Goro denies her, he does not take apprentices. Kaldrake talks to Belnades as she attempts to tie the mast. Kaldrake isn't much help, but is able to ask about Wallachia, as they are heading to Brasov. Belnades explains that the area is united under the god Eru, and is primarily human. Kaldrake mentions that they aren't privy to magic (which Belnades says is clear), and asks how talented Belnades is with magic. She responds that she is still learning, but is able to set a nearby crate on fire to show her abilities. Gertrude spends her time bonding with an albatross in an attempt to get more information on the surrounding area. The albatross excitedly said there are people in Brasov, but isn't able to give much more information as, being an albatross, it does not understand human culture enough to report on it.

That night, Lexar talks with Skalazar a bit more. Skalazar reveals that he was fired from the docks after eating all the oranges. Lexar magically cleans Skalazar's clothes for him, and creates an illusory orange with he gives Skalazar before walking away and ending the illusion. Meanwhile, Moiloc prays to Shurima, asking if her father is really dead as her vision implied. Shurima said he may tell her in exchange for a secret. She says she lied to Aslan in an attempt to get him to meet her father. Shurima is pleased with this, and tells her that her father is alive, but not for much longer. However, he also says her path does not yet lead to her home. He also warns Shurima, but says the area she is heading to is under his control and she should be safe, although the great old ones have awoken. He mentions Olidamuru, the god of Chaos, specifically. There is a great old one in each area, causing the many disasters, and specifically, there are two in Kodlak islands.
# Days 5-24
## Wavecrasher
Branwyn, having the same idea as Kaldrake, asks Belnades about Brasov. Belnades assures her that the city is safe to outsiders if you stay out of the inquisitors' way. Later on the journey, Branwyn is able to crack the code in the book on Mora stolen form Gwyneth's office. It depicts Gwyneth's findings while tracking Mora. Mora had lived in Gravewatch, an area called Grovewatch before a wizard blighted the land during the war and the name was changed. Around then, Mora left the area, not to be seen again until recently, where she may have been seen in Maedrosi, an ancient tree and local landmark.

Kaldrake also speaks with Belnades again, and the two form a friendship. Thank goodness, because his fantasy mom had been sending fantasy texts on his fantasy phone asking if he had been making friends. Gertrude writes letters to her sons and ex-husband saying she's okay, she loves them, she's on an adventure, and may not return for some time. Lexar pulls a series of pranks on the others after giving Skalazar the illusory orange. He freezes Kaldrake's pillow. One night, Lexar and Moiloc agree to throw a party on the last night of the journey to try and get David out of his funk. At the party, Kaldrake, Branwyn, and Gertrude grab some alcohol and leave to get drunk on their own, while Lexar uses his Unseen Servant to let David win a game of shuffleboard. Not many people stayed at the party, but Skalazar appreciated the opportunity to have some fun and became friends with Lexar, however David remained unresponsive despite Lexar's efforts.
# Day 25
## Docks
Around noon the day after the party, Belnades announces they have arrived. Brasov is a bustling fishing town, although smaller than a large city, but it seems fairly peaceful. Gertrude notices that seagulls are the only living creatures in the town besides the citizens. Branwyn, knowing the Inquisitors tend to recruit orphans in the city, tells Charlotte to stay close as they explore the town.

Moiloc is the first to leave, and Branwyn and Gertrude follow in an attempt to get their lost items back and investigate the town. Contigo and Lortzgab go with them. Terren stays on the ship, and it seems Contigo and Terren may have made a connection on the ship, maybe more than a friend-ship. Moiloc tells the others about the Adventurer's Guild, thinking it would be a good place to go for information and perhaps help on temporary housing. On their way to the Guild, Gertrude still notices no other animals except some guard dogs, not even rats as you would expect. She brings this up to the others, wondering about the possibility of exterminators. Lortzgab says extermination is Wallachia's specialty, and quietly expresses his disdain for Wallachia, mentioning they weed out all non-believers annually. As they make their way through the town, they notice a man tied to a wheel hoisted above the town, dead, displayed as an example, Lortzgab explains.

Goro stops Kaldrake as he leaves the ship, asking him if he can attempt to find a safe place for Aslan in the town. Goro says if he hasn't heard from them in three days, he will leave in an attempt to find a better safe haven for Aslan before his ship's rations run out. Now that Kaldrake and Belnades are friends, Belnades offers to take him to the inquisitors' monastery since he has to report back anyway. When Kaldrake asks why he was in Montrissad in the first place, Belnades admits they were there to take it over. Lexar decides to join Kaldrake and Belnades in going to the monastery as well.
## Monastery
Belnades leads Kaldrake and Lexar to the monastery, which is decorated as you would expect of a cathedral or large church. At the end of the entrance hall is a large, dark statue of [[Eru]]. Some monks at the entrance bow, as does Belnades in response. Belnades leads the two to the official's office at the end of the hall, knocks twice, and a voice from behind the door tells them to enter.

A [[Father Gregor|very old man]] is sat at a giant desk (as in a desk which could be used by a giant) which seems to be carved out of a single log. The old man is very fat and is adorned in red robes and a small, white, triangular hat that perfectly is snuggled in the bald spot at the top of his head. The desk is covered in a messy assortment of various documents and other papers. He welcomes Belnades as she enters.

Belnades says she comes with terrible news, that their group failed in their mission. She mentions that he was able to bring back some possible new followers, and motions to Kaldrake and Lexar. Kaldrake introduces himself as the son of Martin, who the official calls a heathen. Lexar mentions that he is a former member of the Cult of Miasma but has made the decision to switch as recommended by [[Father Sansor]]. The official seems pleased by this, and tells Kaldrake and Lexar to leave him and Belnades to discuss some items. He says they will meet [[Ponce]] at the door at the other end of the hall who will help them begin their initiation. The pair leave, and Kaldrake presses Lexar as to why he came to the monastery. Lexar does the same, neither state much of a reason, but they agree to reveal everything if they make it out of this situation.

Lexar and Kaldrake meet Ponce at their barracks, and he motions toward a crate in the back filled with ceremonial garb which will be used in their initiation. Ponce explains that their initiation would begin in the morning, as it is late, but they are welcome to join him and the two others in the barracks in a game of cards for a bit before they head to sleep.
## Adventurer's Guild
After some time wandering around the city, Contigo asks a guard to lead them to the Adventurer's Guild. Moiloc approaches the front desk to ask if she could get some replacement supplies or armor, but is told that only members of the adventurer's guild can take advantage of the benefits, and most local blacksmiths only serve members. In order to become a member, the party must complete one of the contracts on the community board. They also ask about Monty, but are told that nobody has seen a tall, beardless dwarf. After looking through the community board, the group settles on a contract to exorcise a demon from a building in town.
