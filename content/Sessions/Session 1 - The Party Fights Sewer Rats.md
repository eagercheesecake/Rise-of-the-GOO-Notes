### Logline
*Five adventurers enter a city-wide competition in an attempt to have any wish granted. The group finds themselves exploring a sewer for their first challenge.*
### Synopsis
Gertrude gets Jacob to enroll in the games. Branwyn meets Monty, who offers himself as a sponsor if she enrolls in the games. Moiloc takes a job at the Hatched Pig Inn to get a room while she is in town on a diplomatic mission. Lexar helps settle a disagreement between two cart riders who got in a crash. The king announces the games will be cooperative this year. Kaldrake and Lexar begin an alliance, and soon recruit Branwyn and Moiloc. Gertrude hears bears are being put in danger for the games, and goes to the arena to rescue them but is unable to enter. The others learn they need a king's seal to gain entry to the games, and find an opportunity at the nearby docks. They are transported to the sewers, where they have a run-in with Shurima the Corpsemaker, who runs them out before they are able to get a seal. Upon returning to the inn, Gertrude hears the group's discussion of their trial, and offers to join their team on the condition they try and save the bears from the Grand Melee.
# Day 1 
## Gertrude 
We meet [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]], who is on her way to the shops to get treats for her bears. The shop is manned by [[Jacob]], a young and scrawny boy, who tells Gertrude that [[King Aslan]] has bought up all of the bear treats recently, and he can't provide her with any. After a short talk about disliking the King's reign, Gertrude is able to convince Jacob to follow his dreams and join the Games. 
## Branwyn 
We meet [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], who is looking for someone to sell an object of value to. She sees a [[Monty's Son|suspicious man]] selling furs on the streets. After realizing he won't answer any of her questions, he directs her to his dad's shop, [[Monty MacMasters|Monty the Magnificent]]'s House of Miracles. On the way, she is attacked by an amateur thief, no older than 16. He hits Branwyn hard in the back, but she is able to defend herself, and leaves him unconscious and very hurt in the alley. She leaves him a gold as an apology. 

Arriving at Monty's, Branwyn witnesses Monty ripping off a boy for a sword. Branwyn talks to Monty once the boy leaves, asking for connections to sell this object of hers- revealed to be a coat. After some haggling, Monty realizes he isn't going to pull a fast one on her, and proposes a deal. He takes her down a hallway, deeper than the building appeared to be from the outside. He shows her a vault, filled with gold and treasures, and offers to be her sponsor in the upcoming Games. Hesitant to join the Games, Branwyn asks if she can sleep on it, and Monty agrees, giving her 150 gold as a preliminary gift. He also gives her a letter that will provide her a room at the local inn. 
## Moiloc 
We meet [[Moiloc Kodlaksdottër|Moiloc]], who is looking for an inn to settle at for the upcoming Games. However, the busy nature of the town during the festivities brings her to get trapped in the crowd. She sees an ash-grey wrinkled hand on a staff in the crowd, and sensing something from him, tries to make her way to him. Along the way, someone in the busy streets steals 20 gold from her. She strikes up a conversation with the [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|wrinkled man]], who directs her toward a creepy alley. There she finds the corpse of a priest, clutching a red behelit, which she takes, before making her way to the inn once again. 
## Lexar 
We meet [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], who is making his way to being front and center at the announcement of the Games. Along the way, he sees the road to the procession is blocked by two carts, which seem to have crashed. One man is a banker, and the other is a larger, older man who is angrily insisting he pay for the repairs. Lexar, hoping to get to the games, suggests they settle this argument through a game, fitting of the festivities. This upsets the older man, who attacks Lexar. Lexar hides behind the banker, who the older man attacks while trying to get to Lexar. He knocks the banker out, and Lexar points out that he has, at this point, won the "game," and can take what he wants from the banker's cart. 
## The Hatched Pig Inn 
Branwyn arrives at the inn first, and shows her letter to [[Jim MacMasters|Jim]], the innkeeper. The letter is simply a request from Monty to pamper Branwyn with a room. The inn is packed, very busy, but Jim is able to provide one for her. In the meantime, Branwyn perches herself at a booth in the back to watch the locals and gather information on the Games to help make her decision. 

We meet [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], the next to arrive, who reserves a room on the third floor of the inn. It's clean, but has no windows. He spends some time in his room, getting settled. 

Gertrude is the next to arrive, as it is too late to return, and she still is looking for treats, or the reason the King has taken them all, worried for the safety of the possible bears he is using for the Games. There are horsemen with the king's crest on their suits, and guilts them with her age into telling her that there is word the bears are being used in the Game. Foot in the door, Gertrude threatens to tell the King that they have given her confidential information to get more information on the bears' safety, and is told they are being used in a melee. Conflicted, she flips a coin to decide if she is going to stay in Montrissad and try to save the bears, or return to the woods to care for her own. It lands heads- save the bears here. 

Moiloc arrives at the inn, deciding she is going to sleep in the stables after seeing the price of rooms. Soon after, her and Kaldrake separately make their way to the proclamation of this year's Games. Gertrude stays and plans her rescue. 
## Stage
The stage is made of majestic marble. The council, in brown robes, enter the stage to the tune of the country's anthem, a bardcore cover of Hips Don't Lie. There are fireworks as King Aslan arrives. He gives a speech, saying no one man will excel this year, and that the games are all about teamwork. With this, he leaves, and one of the councilmen announces that the rules will be distributed the following morning, and that the contestants should return to their lodging. They know who the contestants are, and will get them the rules. 
## The Hatched Pig Inn
The party returns to the inn, as Lexar has received a note that he needs to head there and meet up with Kaldrake, who he has been instructed to protect. Gertrude, not able to pay for a room, sleeps in the stables, while Moiloc is able to get a room by working at the inn as a waitress. She talks with Branwyn for a very brief moment, before Lexar enters by cheering about the games, which attracts Moiloc's attention. Lexar and Kaldrake meet, and it is revealed that Kaldrake's sister has hired Lexar to protect him. Lexar takes two ales from the inn and returns home, as the inn isn't quality enough for him, promising Jim he will return the mugs in the morning, and agreeing to meet with Kaldrake once the rules have been announced. 
# Day 2 
## The Hatched Pig Inn 
Gertrude awakes in the stables to find a note placed on her stomach. Moiloc, Kaldrake, and Lexar each receive notes under their doors, and meet up in the tavern of the inn. The rules state that there will be 3-10 people per team, and they need to find a seal marked with the king's face, and turn it in to the Montrissad Palace. This will grant them entry into the Games. Lexar and Kaldrake immediately agree to be on a team. Moiloc overhears that they need a third, and takes it as a sign that this team is for her. She asks to join, and after a team meeting, is accepted. Lexar recalls that guards tend to have parties at the docks, and thinks that as good a place as any to being their search. Moiloc, having a protagonist complex, leads the way, despite not knowing the town like Lexar. Lexar doesn't correct her misdirection, finding it funny. 
## Montrissad Streets
Gertrude makes her way to the arena after seeing a bounty board declaring a grand melee will take place there every day for three days, wondering if the bears were there. She sees Shurima in the crowd on her way, much like Moiloc did, and notices he is holding a paper. She asks if it's a map, and he says no, hiding it. She asks if he's in the games, thinking it may be the rules sheet, and he also declines that, saying he is too old and antisocial, but he did receive an invite. He begins to leave after this, and Gertrude walks into a nearby shop to ask for the location of the arena. 
## Monty the Magnificent's House of Miracles
Branwyn returns to Monty to talk terms on their deal. She ensures with him that no strings are attached to this so that she isn't surprised by any of his demands, but that he will get any rewards from the bets he makes toward her. He agrees with this, and asks that she comes to him with any needs that may arise during the games. Once she accepts, a guard enters the shop with a letter for Branwyn- the team instructions. 
## Arena 
Gertrude arrives at the arena, and hundreds of people are signing up for the Grand Melee. She finds a guy who is vaping near the entrance, and once telling him she wants in but doesn't want to join, he directs her to the audience entrance. The arena interior has two large doors for competitors on the north and south walls, and Gertrude detects that the doors are magical. There is a billboard on which the competitors' names are magically appearing, with about 300 names on it so far. There are trapdoors on the arena floor. Realizing she won't be able to rescue the bears from the stands, she makes her way outside again to a guard entrance to the arena, currently manned by one guard. 
## Docks 
Branwyn returns to the inn, and asks Jim where Moiloc was, as Moiloc had made it very publicly known that she is joining the games. Jim directs her to the docks and gives her a letter to deliver to Lexar. Branwyn gets there at about the same time as the others, since Moiloc had gone the wrong way multiple times. Branwyn gives Monty's letter to Lexar, and is accepted into the team after a brief team meeting. At the docks, the group notices a thick fog. They enter, but return without finding anything. 
## Arena
Gertrude notices the guard has good armor and seems experienced. There is an explosion and cheers from the front of the arena, and she tries to get the guard to check it out, hoping to sneak in during his absence, but he won't leave his post. She makes her way to the front to see what the explosion was. There she sees a [[Gwyneth Sootspot|female elf wizard]] demonstrating a pyrokinesis ability. Gertrude tries to use the attention this wizard is drawing to sneak in, but is caught by the guards. She claims she was looking for a bathroom, they point her to the audience entrance. She claims those bathrooms are full, they tell her there are bears in this one, so she can't go in for her own safety. She threatens to piss, they threaten to arrest her if she does. 

Realizing those guards aren't letting her in, she awaits a guard switch. During the switch she tries to sneak in again, but is again immediately thrown out, being recognized as the previous "piss grandma." After being called this, Gertrude questions if any of this was worth it, and decides she is leaving Montrissad to return home. 
## Sewers
The group is still looking through the fog, trying to be careful not to alert the other contestants checking the docks in case they find anything. Lexar sees some guards by a warehouse, and calls the others over. The group is nervous about approaching them, but Lexar, believing the guards have already noticed them, waves at them. They wave back. The team approaches them, and upon entering the warehouse, the guards give them a pitying look. The fog is still thick in the warehouse, and a staff can be seen casting a spell before the group re-appears in what Kaldrake recognizes to be a sewer, which he is familiar with after being hazed during college. On his way to report to the others, he receives a fantasy text from his fantasy mom on his fantasy phone asking if he's having a good time in the Games.

At the end of the room is a table with a king's seal, a torch, a red bottle, and a note. Lexar takes the seal, Moiloc takes the torch, Kaldrake takes the note and key, and Branwyn takes the bottle. Looking up at a grate, Lexar notices they are far underground, as the light is coming from far above them. There is a grate at the end of the hall which is locked, and as Kaldrake uses the key to unlock it, a crash is heard from around the corner. Moiloc recognizes it as something hitting the water, perhaps a body. 

Moiloc and Kaldrake lead as they advance around the corner and down the hall to see a large open room ending in a ledge to a deep drop. Moiloc calls out to see if anyone is there after the noise, but hears nothing. There are three barrels by the ledge. Kaldrake drops a gold down the ledge, and after three seconds, hears it hit the bottom. A squeak is also heard from the bottom. Moiloc opens a barrel and sees it is filled with gunpowder. She kicks the barrel in and drops the torch, as her teammates yell after her to not drop their only light source. Three shapes are blasted back as the barrel explodes, and the light of the explosion momentarily lights up a ladder descending the drop. The smell of burnt fur and the sound of silence is all that remains. All teams descend, and Moiloc grabs a new torch that she brought with her. At the bottom are giant rat carcasses, badly burnt. Another distant squeak is heard from the hall to the team's left, then many squeaks. The team quickly advances down the other hallway, immediately forward. 

In their rush down the hallway, Kaldrake almost slips, and Moiloc helps him up. Branwyn brought some gunpowder with her from the barrels, and uses it to light the tunnel ablaze behind them, blocking the rats by blowing up some of the walkway. At the end of the hallway is a door, which Branwyn also explodes. Moiloc sees nine rats as they approach the next room, only to find themselves back in the room they started in. Turning back, the hall they came from seems to no longer be there. The only difference from how the room was left is a statue of a hero with a sword, which only Lexar seems to be able to see. The statue's hand is extended, as if it is asking for something. Thinking it may want the potion, Lexar asks Branwyn if he can use it, which she reluctantly agrees to, since it seems as if Lexar is motioning to nothing and has gone crazy. The statue drops the potion after a moment, and the room shakes, revealing a hole where the statue once was, with a staircase leading down to a circular room filled with corpses. Many squeaks can be heard here again, and the team quickly descends through a grate in the center, which Moiloc slides back as she descends. 

There's a slide below the grate which leads to another room full of corpses, surrounding Shurima, who lifts a corpse and puts it in a bag. There is a door behind him. He notices the team, and tells them that they need to kill all of his rats to escape, calling himself the "rat-friend," before realizing that doesn't sound as cool as he wanted it to, and switching it to "rat-lord." He accidentally refers to this as the "first round" of the Games. He also claims that all they would need to beat this challenge is a behelit, revealing that he has five. He gives the team a chance to resign by giving him the sigil, which the team agrees to initially, before Lexar talks them into fighting since he had the sigil and refused to hand it over, claiming they can give it to him later if things go south. The fight goes south very quickly as they are outnumbered by rats. Lexar attempts to learn what his behelit does, taking Moiloc's as well to see if the power multiplies since Shurima has five. She gives him the behelit, telling him he will be giving it back. Branwyn, meanwhile, steals the sigil from Lexar, recognizing the danger the group is in, and gives it to Shurima, who returns them to the docks. Lexar tells Branwyn this was a well-played move, happy from the excitement alone. Moiloc physically threatens Lexar to give her back the behelit she lent him. He asks her to ask politely, saying she doesn't need to resort to violence and had been so nice up until now. She does, and he gives it back. 
## The Hatched Pig Inn
The team returns to the inn and discuss the rats, which Gertrude overhears, and joins the conversation at the mention of animals being used in the games. She says she will join their team on the conditions that she gets a bear-sitter for back home, that nobody judges her for her piss-grandma moment, and that they try and save the bears at the arena. The team thinks that may be a little easier than what they went through, decide the rats aren't a feasible option, and agree. They go to bed for the night.
