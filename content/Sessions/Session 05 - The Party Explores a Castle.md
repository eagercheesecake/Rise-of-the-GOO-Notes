The team looks for quarters for the night, and run into Rynn at the High End Inn. Kaldrake, Branwyn, and Lexar confront her after she steals from Moiloc, but they are unable to show evidence and leave her be. Mayor McCheese is kicked out of his room to accommodate for Moiloc, a princess. Moiloc and Lexar go to give the other seal to Lexar's friends, David. David and the Horse Men enroll in the games. Branwyn and Kaldrake find a portal in Gwyneth's room while trying to dispel Gertrude's curse, and are pulled into Martin's Isle, which is being attacked by a drow army. They are able to escape through a teleportation mirror in Kaldrake's parents' room, and find themselves in Monty's office, where Branwyn finds a letter explaining that Mora may be causing trouble on every corner of Phaeros. The adventurers regroup in the castle as the games begin, and head to the barracks where the king is housing them, awaiting a grand feast.
# Day 4
## Monty the Magnificent's House of Miracles
After a very short nap, [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] and [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] wake up to [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] knocking on the door. The three regroup, make coffee, and head back to [[Monty MacMasters|Monty's]], which has now opened for the day. In the main store, Monty's son leads them to the hall door and points out the room [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] and [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] are sleeping in. Gertrude lets herself in and wakes them up. Moiloc begins telling Gertrude and Kaldrake, who had yet to meet Monty, about Monty and the night before. Branwyn closes the door, prepared to discuss some topics she would rather Monty not hear. The group takes turns debriefing each other, about the inn burning down, Gertrude's experience with the citizens, Kaldrake's with the corpse-eaters, Lexar's with his neighbor.

Branwyn is still suspicious about Monty, and Lexar and Kaldrake don't trust him based on what they've heard. The five decide to try and go to Monty's office and explore some more. Branwyn knocks quietly on the office door, to no response, Moiloc knocks pretty loudly to no response again, so they decide to enter, but the door is locked. Not wanting to leave evidence of their snooping by breaking a door down, the crew decides to leave. On their way out, Gertrude makes a comment on Monty's son appearance, and Branwyn tells her puberty is hard, and to not comment on it.

Teddy & the Roosevelts decide to turn in their seal before they are attacked again. On their way to the Montrissad Castle, Gertrude realizes her memory loss may be due to a curse, and detects magic on herself to reveal that she is, in fact, cursed, with a dark blue aura implying it's some sort of necromancy. Kaldrake mentions that his sister is the court wizard, and she may be able to remove the curse once they arrive at the castle. Branwyn comments on the corpse-eaters and the attack on the inn, wondering what group could be behind it. She wonders about how much manpower they have and recruitment, and Lexar mentions that he's in a cult, but plays it down.
## Castle Gates
In front of the castle is a table with twelve seals on it and two guards behind it. As Moiloc goes to turn it in, Branwyn begins to notice that it is clearly not the actual turn-in spot. She confronts the fake guards, who wrap up the seals and bolt. Branwyn is able to shoot one of them with a crossbow as they escape through the moat, but both are able to escape.
## Castle Courtyard
The crew find the real turn-in station for the seals in the castle courtyard. They notice that there are about nine seals on the table, and since this is the last day to turn in the seals, it gives them an idea about how much competition they will have. Lexar turns in his seal, and tells Moiloc to hold on to hers. The guards tell them to return later that night. The five discuss what to use the other seal on. Gertrude suggests giving it to one of her many sons, [[Gordon Spugel|Gordon]], the oldest and most estranged of her sons. He lives in town, but Gertrude hasn't seen him since he was little, about thirty years ago. Lexar suggests giving it to a friend of his, David, to get another larger team in the games that they can ally with. Branwyn suggests simply selling it to the highest bidder.

They consider for a while longer, but soon realize that they also no longer have a place to stay for the night. Lexar mentions a few inns in town: The Beached Rat Inn is a very run-down inn, the High End Inn is better but more expensive, both have lice. Branwyn decides to send a letter to Monty for inn recommendations, telling him to deliver his response to Lexar's house. In the meantime, the five explore the town in search for another inn.
## High End Inn
Approaching the High End Inn, the group notice a two-foot [[Rynn|goblin woman]] getting kicked out of the inn, palming something on her way out. Moiloc helps her up, but Lexar and Branwyn are suspicious of the goblin since she was just kicked out of the inn, likely for good reason, and discuss a plan. Branwyn sneaks behind the woman to see her hiding a pouch. Lexar pulls Moiloc aside while Branwyn keeps watch on the goblin woman, telling Moiloc to be careful. Lexar also asks Moiloc to check she still has the seal in case it was pickpocketed off her. Moiloc thinks this is presumptuous, and checks to confirm the seal is still there.

The goblin woman makes a run for it, and is able to get past Branwyn trying to stop her. Branwyn chases after her, and Lexar and Kaldrake follow. The three corner the goblin in an alley, and question her. Lexar learns her name is Rynn, but the three are unable to find the pouch Branwyn saw, and without evidence leave Rynn in the alley. Moiloc notices when checking if she has enough to afford the High End Inn that she is missing fifteen gold.

This isn't an issue, however, as once Moiloc reveals to the inn that she is a princess, they empty out Room 45 for her, free of charge. The person removed from the room is the old Mayor of Montrissad, [[Mayor McCheese]], who supported the deforestation of nearby wilderness, which would greatly affect Branwyn and Gertrude, who are not happy with him. He was also the mayor when the Kodlak Islands were at unrest with Montrissad, so Moiloc is also not too guilty about him being kicked out for their sake. Branwyn and Kaldrake arrived last to the room, and play rock-paper-scissors over who gets the couch and who gets the last bed. Kaldrake gets the couch.

The group decides their best course of action to help themselves in the games is to give the last seal to [[David]]. Moiloc and Lexar make their way over, and Branwyn, Kaldrake, and Gertrude begin heading to [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth's]] tower to get Gertrude's curse removed.
## Gwyneth's Tower
Gwyneth's office is empty when they arrive. Kaldrake notices a blank envelope on Gwyneth's desk, and decides to open it. It seems to be from the Ethereum, the magic college in Martin's Isle, as noted by the seal on the open envelope. Kaldrake reads the letter, and learns [[Martin Sootspot|Martin]], Kaldrake's grandfather, was experimenting with something, but the experiments were proceeding poorly. The letter is from the university's headmaster, and there were many technical terms that Kaldrake couldn't understand, but it's clear that Martin's experiments are still continuing, and are not going well.

Branwyn notices an inkwell that has been knocked off of Gwyneth's desk. The ink doesn't seem to be regular ink, and smells foul when Branwyn goes to investigate. Gertrude looks out the tower window, and sees the two fake guards turn in their twelve seals. She calls Branwyn over, who notices that the guard she shot has been healed.

Branwyn and Kaldrake begin looking into the bookshelf for more information, and notice that a book on Kaldrake's family genealogy was askew. They both immediately think it may be a secret passage, and pull the book to see a green portal emerge behind the moving bookshelf. Branwyn puts her hand in and comes out unscathed, but Kaldrake is pulled into the portal as he approaches.
## David's Farm
Lexar and Moiloc proceed to David's. On their way, Lexar informs Moiloc that he was one of David's groomsmen when David got married to his husband, David. David's best friend recently passed, so Lexar warns Moiloc to not bring it up. David works as a horse farmer, providing horses for the king and his men. He is a beautiful man, 6 foot 4 inches, and muscular from the manual labor. He does not come from money, but makes a decent living with his contract with the king. Lexar and Moiloc make it to the farm to see him riding a horse in the fields. Lexar motions him over, and they agree to meet inside David's house. The horse is very well trained, but as Moiloc goes to pet it, David warns that Dash Man does bite.

In the home, Lexar pitches the deal to David, who agrees, reluctantly, to enroll with his farmhands, but his husband stays home. As David gets ready, Lexar warns him about the other characters on his team.
## Martin's Isle
Kaldrake appears on the other side of the portal in a prison cell. The door to the cell is open, but he is soon met with an explosive blast from the outside hall, but manages to find cover. Kaldrake steps out, but is met with another blast, which grazes him with some rubble. He hears screams, sees fire, and quickly realizes that his home's castle is under siege.

Branwyn tells Gertrude to find the others and not follow her in case it is a trap, and to send help once she is able to reunite with Lexar and Moiloc. Branwyn enters the portal as well and meets up with Kaldrake. As Kaldrake looks out over the attackers, he notices that the shores to Martin's Isle look a bit different, wondering if the portal somehow took her to another time.

An elf in golden armor, the armor of Martin's Isle's royal guard, is thrown into the hall by three figures in dark silver, almost a purplish black, armor. The royal guard soldier attempts to attack, but misses. He is struggling to stand. He notices Branwyn and Kaldrake, and warns them that the attackers are trying to kill Martin.

> [!danger] Fight
> Kaldrake attacks the third attacker with his crossbow, and the attacker looks pretty rough after the initial attack. The second attacker tries to take out the royal guard, but their armor is too tough. The first attacker retaliates against Kaldrake with a crossbow but misses. The third attacker also retaliates against Kaldrake and is able to hit him in the head with his blunt weapon. Branwyn hits the first attacker with her crossbow, who is still going strong after the hit, but the royal guard makes an attempt to take him down in the confusion and falls to the ground himself. Kaldrake lunges his morning star into the first attacker, hits them in the face, their helmet crumples, and the attacker falls to the ground, dead. The first attacker notices the royal guard has fallen, and takes the opportunity to decapitate him.
> 
> The second attacker attacks Kaldrake and misses, and Kaldrake takes the opportunity to riposte. After this attack the second attacker's armor is noticeably dent. Branwyn misses the first attacker, Kaldrake misses the second, they are able to block with their swords. The first attacker's sword couldn't get through Kaldrake's armor, and the second one outright misses Branwyn. Branwyn shoots the first attacker in the shoulder, and Kaldrake knocks off the second attacker's helmet with his attacking, revealing that the attackers are drow. This drow attacks and misses Kaldrake, as does the first drow. Branwyn is able to shoot the first in the neck, causing him to fall to one knee, and Kaldrake hits the now-exposed head of the second attacker, killing them. The first drow is able to get one hit in through Kaldrake's armor, but Branwyn shoots them right through the eye slit of their armor, killing them.

Branwyn and Kaldrake take a moment to catch their breath, but are soon brought back to reality by another explosion, which they both are able to avoid, although Branwyn is launched back a bit by the force. The explosion reveals balls of fire being thrown at the castle, an army of drow, giant spiders, and a black dragon, so the pair decide to act quickly.

The halls of the castle are already filled with soldiers, and Kaldrake is wearing recognizable armor, so Branwyn uses disguise self to disguise herself as a drow soldier, smears blood on Kaldrake, and tries to play it off as taking a prisoner as they go into the main hall and ascend to the upper floors. After the corpse-eaters, this is too much for Kaldrake, and he develops a squeamishness. They decide to head to Kaldrake's parents room to see if they are safe.

>[!danger] Fight
>Inside are two more drow guards ransacking the bedroom. Branwyn ambushes the second drow, hitting them twice with her bow, they're already pretty hurt. Kaldrake tries to finish them off with his own bow, but misses. The first drow slashes Kaldrake with their sword, and the second does the same to Branwyn. Branwyn retaliates with her axe, taking the drow to a very weak state. Kaldrake bonks the first drow with his morning star, and they retaliate by slashing Kaldrake with their sword, deep. Kaldrake collapses. Branwyn slashes the second drow in the clavicle, finally taking them down. The remaining drow turns to Branwyn now, slashing her, causing Branwyn to stumble and miss her attack. Branwyn is able to get one more hit in before the drow also fatally slashes her, causing her to drop. Kaldrake, at this moment, regains enough strength to make one final move. Out of a blind rage, he throws his morning star at the drow, killing him.

Branwyn is fading fast. Kaldrake begins looking for help in his parents' room, but it's trashed and that makes it difficult. He finds two red vials, and flawlessly reasoning that red means healing, gives them to Branwyn. Luckily, they were in fact healing potions, and Branwyn stabilizes, just to immediately be met with another explosion, causing the ceiling to collapse in. Recognizing the danger, Branwyn uses cure wounds to bring both of them up to a safe health before looking for an escape. Kaldrake hears a notification on his fantasy phone and sees a fantasy text from his fantasy mom saying Life 360 said his battery is low and he needs to charge it.

A psychic shriek makes the two wince in pain. Through the ceiling, they can see the dragon fighting some figure glowing in a holy white flame. Branwyn notices shattered glass, and Kaldrake recognizes it as a teleportation mirror. They reassemble the mirror, and Kaldrake struggles over the activation phrase. Branwyn suggests it is likely very personal to the user, and Kaldrake says his family motto: "Can't be worse than here."

They are teleported to Monty's office, and immediately search for health potions. They don't find any, but Kaldrake finds a cool coaster, and Branwyn takes a crimson talon. Not taking a moment to consider why Monty has an artifact as powerful and rare as that mirror, the pair take the opportunity in Monty's office to do the snooping they were unable to do earlier. Branwyn searches the files, and finds a letter to Monty. It states there is danger in Phaeros,. There are fish men attacking the Kodlak Islands, a cult in Montrissad, drow in Martin's Isla, warlords fighting, something about Majeros. It also mentions that Branwyn's forest is no longer alive, which is not news to her, but it also states that [[Mora]] has begun her move. This shakes Branwyn, as this is her adopted parent of sorts. Branwyn had thought Mora had left this plane. Unable to find any other clues, Branwyn takes the letter, and she and Kaldrake leave to return to the castle and reunite with Gertrude.
## Castle Grounds
Lexar, Moiloc, and David arrive back to the castle, and David turns in his seal, entering himself and seven farmhands, plus their horses. They enroll under the team name David and the Horse Men. It is soon announced that the next stage of the games are about to begin. Each team is provided temporary quarters in the barracks, with a special garb they are suggested to wear to a feast that will be held at sundown. The group takes in some of their competitors.

Gertrude sees a group in silver armor, gold gauntlets, and mock wings. Lexar recognizes them as the Inquisitors of the Hawk, professional mercenaries from Melakia, who have been known to resort to rather extreme measure. They are responsible for killings in the village of Horcus in a war about ten years ago. The town was burned and all villagers impaled as a message. They tend to have minimal recruits, and rely on training orphans to get new members. There are five of them in this group. They also recognize Rynn among the challengers, although they are unable to determine much more as the contestants go to explore their rooms.
