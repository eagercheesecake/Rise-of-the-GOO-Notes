# Day 32
## Rebel Hideout
[[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], [[Lothar (Brewster) Nash|Brewster]], and [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] proceed into the Rebel hideout. Inside are disheveled and malnourished refugees. In the back is a table handing out rations to the refugees. Moiloc goes to join the table, giving away all of her rations.

Brewster and Branwyn proceed to Brewster's lab, audible recognizable by the squelching sounds of [[Dr. Nubgrub]] working on the body of a corpse flayer. Brewster asks if Nubgrub messed with any of his stuff while he's been gone, and finds that he actually took pretty good care of his items. Nubgrub tells Brewster of the corpse flayers coming into the hideout from the door connecting to the sewers. Branwyn looks at Nubgrub's work on the body of the corpse flayer, finding hooks holding the body open allowing Nubgrub to examine it. Branwyn concludes that the corpse eaters can only regenerate if the wound is closed, and the hooks keeping it open prevented it from healing. Branwyn prods Nubgrub for more information. He explains that they aren't alive, but uses a scalpel to cut into the thigh, which stitches itself back together immediately. Nubgrub has dubbed the monsters "gray boys," and Branwyn says they had been calling them corpse eaters. Nubgrub asks if she had seen them eating a corpse, and when Branwyn confirms that she has, he points out that this particular corpse flayer's last meal was a bird. He also says that the corpse flayer came in through the hideout's entrance to the tunnel, as they occasionally do, but it doesn't seem the creatures are intelligent enough to seek out the hideout - it's more that they just stumble in. Brewster asks if Dr. Nubgrub knows anything about vampires, and he says all that he knows is that they're bite-y.

After giving away her rations, Moiloc talks to a few of the refugees. Most of them seem to be citizens who were purged from Lothric. [[Gorm]] survived, but all of his raiders perished in the explosion in Brasov. Moiloc reunites with Branwyn and Brewster, and they head to a meeting room where [[Violet]] and some others are talking strategy.

In the meeting room is Violet, Gorm, [[Jessie Harkness|Jessie]], and some others who were not at Dunn. One is [[Feris]], the head of the Resistance in Loth. He is an elven war veteran with an iron leg. The other is [[Edward Tallow]], a handsome human man with silver eyes, wearing priest robes. The five of them are deep is discussion when the trio enters. Violet seems happy that they have returned, and asks them to join them at the table. First, Brewster pulls Violet aside, telling her [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] is dead, since he noticed they had built a rapport. Violet doesn't seem to affected by this news. All eight members gather at the table, and Violet introduces Edward, who is revealed to be the assistant to [[Pontiff Sulyvahn]], helping the Resistance with their plans since he has direct access to the Pontiff. Moiloc feels uneasy about him, but can't tell why.

Brewster fills everyone in on what had happened in his absence. Notably, he tells them of the Braetons and vampires in the Chateau, as well as the blueprints to the lab that he was unable to decipher. Nobody else at the table seems to be able to decipher it either. Before continuing, Brewster tries to motion to Violet that he thinks Branwyn and Moiloc shouldn't be a part of the meeting, but she doesn't seem to notice.

Violet takes her turn to fill the three in on the happenings of the Resistance during their absence. She begins by telling them about a contest occurring in a week at Fort Bosco which is going to crown a new champion for the [[Queen Cypha|queen]]. This champion would have direct access to the Queen, so if one of them could win, it could get them in proximity to her for their plans, but only Inquisitors are invited. However, the invites aren't specific to their recipients. Anyone who has one can enter, so if they could steal one from one of the recipients, they could enter instead. Branwyn asks if they could ambush someone on the road to Fort Bosco, but Edward points out that, while this isn't necessarily a bad idea, most plans are complicated by the Resistance losing their raiders.

Brewster, thinking it could possibly help, takes out [[King Endrio the Bold|King Endrio's]] cloak. He fills the others in on what they found upon returning to Dunn. He mentions [[Ouroborus Tikktal|Ouroborus]] being gone and her chains being broken, which surprises Violet. Brewster again tries to motion to Violet that Moiloc may be connected to this, since [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima's]] carriage was found outside the cave, but Violet again doesn't notice. Edward takes great interest in the cloak, taking it from Brewster to investigate it, confirming it's real. Brewster doesn't like it in Edward's possession, and takes it back once he starts asking questions. Branwyn, recalling [[Terren Hammerfist|Terren]] has the Hammerfist name, asks Brewster if he believes Terren to be related to Endrio. Brewster believes Terren is the illegitimate son of King Endrio, but doesn't want to betray Teren's trust since he doesn't seem to like talking about it, so he just tells Branwyn that Terren doesn't like talking about it, but it's likely they're related somehow. Branwyn suggests the cloak goes to Terren, keeping it in the bloodline. Brewster, not wanting to give his relic away, puts it back in his bag, saying they're not talking about the cloak anymore.

Branwyn asks if the Resistance knows any Inquisitors who may have received an invite. They mention that one [[Constance Steel]] likely received an invite, but Edward had captured two Inquisitors to try and get more names. Edward clarifies that, while killing Cypha is the ultimate goal, they can't just kill her and be done, since Sulyvahn would likely be elected immediately after. Edward says he can help take out Sulyvahn when the time comes, but can't do it alone. He mentions that Gorm likely isn't going to be that helpful, since he's been out of it since returning from Brasov. Moiloc volunteers to help, wanting to keep an eye on Edward since she feels uneasy about him.

Edward mentions that the Cardinal Sphere will likely elect [[Sister Marie the Confessor]], Whitehall's slave driver, next. However, he believes they could possibly gain enough votes to elect [[Isaac Domnhall]], the Father of Domnhall Keep, located a few miles from Whitehall. Domnhall Keep is a frontier camp, and doesn't support or enforce anti-human policies. Branwyn, Brewster, and Moiloc agree to do some reconnaissance on Constance to start, and proceed from there.

Branwyn, Brewster, and Moiloc split off from the group. After some discussion, they realize it may be best to attack Constance in the forest, since they'd rather fight her there than with a crowd watching during the competition. As Violet leaves the meeting room, Brewster pulls her aside. He expresses to her that he doesn't trust Branwyn and Moiloc due to their support and connections with [[Mora]] and Shurima. Violet doesn't seem to care too much, pointing out that they're trusting Edward of all people as well, and they're in a position where they need to put some faith in sleezy or otherwise untrustworthy humans. Although, she tells Brewster he did good at the Chateau, and tells him to go to the vault and pick something out. Brewster heads that way, and gets a magical crossbow that can attune to his spellcasting ability. Brewster also goes back to his lab to look at the blueprints again with his tools. He begins to decipher that it's some sort of machine that can covert the crystals found in the Dunn caves to ydril. He returns to Violet, who gives him the small crystal she was able to salvage during their escape from Dunn.

Branwyn talks with Jessie, asking about [[Charlotte]]. Jessie tells her that they sent all the children north, where it was safer. This upsets Branwyn, although she understands. She tells Jessie to let Charlotte know that she's there if she needs her, and to find a white raven if she needs anything. She also gives Jessie five gold to pass to Charlotte. Branwyn leaves and returns to the dormitories. Moiloc enters soon after, hearing Branwyn crying. They have a heart-to-heart, and Branwyn tells Moiloc of the body she found in Mora's cabin which looked like Branwyn as a child. She asks Moiloc if all of it is her fault, and if she put Charlotte in danger. Moiloc consoles Branwyn, telling her it's not her fault.
## Gwyneth's Manor
Kaldrake notices that the mole on the painting of [[Martin Sootspot|Martin]] is actually a button. Pressing it, the painting slides up to reveal an ornate lamp, emanating an immense magical aura. Kaldrake hears [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth]] approaching and lowers the painting. As Gwyneth enters the room, she runs to Kaldrake, giving her a big hug: a touching reunion. Kaldrake sits on the couch under the painting of Martin for his conversation with his sister, wanting her to have to look at both her and Martin while explaining herself. The siblings take turns providing explanations.

Kaldrake thanks Gwyneth for reviving him, and asks her how she knew where to find him. She responds that she's been keeping tabs on him through Lexar and her connections at Brasov. Kaldrake asks about Brasov, and Gwyneth says the djinn demanded a price, but she needed him back, so she paid it through Brasov. Gwyneth continues filling Kaldrake in by telling her about Martin. He died at 100, due to making a deal with the dragon [[Bados]], who cursed the family bloodline so nobody could live past 100. Kaldrake realizes that [[Balthazar Sootspot|Balthazar]], the past head of the Ethereum, turned 100 while Kaldrake was in Montrissad. The new head, [[Corellian Sootspot|Corellian]], is 95, so he doesn't have long left. Gwyneth points out that this means she'll be the next head in a few years. Part of Martin's deal with Bados was selling his soul to [[Abaddon]], the god of Fate.

During the invasion on the castle which Kaldrake and Branwyn had witnessed, the drow demanded an artifact that Martin stole from the Underdark. The drow will return soon to claim the artifact, but the family isn't sure where it is. Kaldrake asks if the artifact is a dagger, thinking to her time as [[Gulvayas Hakon|Gulvayas]]. This noticeably shocks Gwyneth, who asks how he knows about that. Kaldrake explains his visions as Gulvayas, and the change in history, confirming it by telling Gwyneth he knows she's going to Fort Bosco soon. Kaldrake asks if Gwyneth knows anything about the Hakon family. Gwyneth denies knowing anything, but Kaldrake notices she's lying and calls her out. Gwyneth tells Kaldrake that they are who attacked Martin's Isle.

While Kaldrake is telling Gwyneth of her time visiting the castle during the attack, she mentions Branwyn, who Gwyneth somehow seems to recognize. Gwyneth tells Kaldrake about Mora. She mentions Mora's soul transposition magic, and what happened in Gravewatch. But notably, she mentions that Mora was an avatar of Maokai, who is old enough that one of them may know about the dagger. Gwyneth asks Kaldrake where Branwyn is, but he doesn't know. Kaldrake asks if Gwyneth knows who Gulvayas is, but she doesn't know either. Kaldrake calls Gwyneth out on the painting, and they bond over how cool the secret paining hiding spot is. Gwyneth seems satisfied with their conversation, and goes to leave, telling Kaldrake to stay in the manor so she doesn't change history. Kaldrake asks if he can talk to the djinn, and Gwyneth says it should be fine, but he'll have to keep the djinn in the room, pointing to a magic protection circle that keeps him bound there.

Gwyneth leaves, and Kaldrake notices a white crystal on the desk in the room that wasn't there before, which he takes. Kaldrake considers summoning the djinn, but realizes he doesn't know how to put him back without making a wish. Kaldrake proceeds to Gwyneth's room to ask how he'd do it, and as he enters, he hears glass clinking together, but is unable to identify what it is. While in her room, Kaldrake asks what the trapdoor leading to the foggy hole is about. Gwyneth mentions it leads to Whitehall, where there's a historian of magic, [[Daphne]], but she's a gnome, so Gwyneth ended up not wanting to speak to her. Gwyneth also mentions her friend, the [[Monty MacMasters|Minister of Coin]], who she gives artifacts to. Kaldrake pokes fun at Gwyneth for this, having read her diary and knowing about her crush.

Kaldrake asks how Gwyneth ended up as the Minister of Magic, and she says the Minister of Coin invited her, and she accepted, partially because of how cool the manor was. She also says that the Queen doesn't seem to care that she's an elf since she "looks human enough." Kaldrake asks about the Rebels, and Gwyneth says she doesn't care about them, or about international affairs. Either way, they have a mole in the Resistance, so it shouldn't be a big deal. Kaldrake guilts Gwyneth into telling him who the mole is since they're siblings, and she lets slip that it's Edward. Edward is ambitious, but likely has his own motives, since assistants to the Pontiff tend to not last long. Sulyvahn likes to cause pain. Kaldrake asks if Gwyneth would care if the Resistance succeeded in killing the Queen, and Gwyneth says if that happens, she can just jump ship. Gwyneth changes the subject, asking how Kaldrake's time with the djinn went, and Kaldrake admits he didn't summon him since he wasn't sure how to put him back. Gwyneth says his name is [[Laogzed]], and she can send him back to the lamp by just saying his name.

Before leaving, Kaldrake asks if Gwyneth cares that he killed [[Father Gregor]], a fact which Gwyneth seemed unaware of. Kaldrake tells the story. Kaldrake also asks about [[Bisco]], who Gwyneth says is a wizard she turned into demon. He probably can't cast Fireball. On his way out, Gwyneth gives Kaldrake a pin depicting the Flaming Fist. Gwyneth leaves for a meeting, but tells Kaldrake he should stop by the Minister of Secrets.

Kaldrake returns to Laogzed, summoning him. He appears as a green figure, chained to the lamp, asking what Kaldrake's wish is. Kaldrake asks what happened to his body, but the djinn doesn't respond, since it wasn't worded as a wish. Kaldrake wishes the djinn would tell him everything he knows about his new powers after being revived. Kaldrake magically gains the knowledge that his powers were given to him through an accident. When he was revived, he was pulled from the Celestial plane, but got tangled with something else that was taken back with him. The djinn asks Kaldrake to free him through a wish, saying he'll provide three wishes if he does so. Kaldrake declines, saying his name, and leaves.
## Lothric
Kaldrake collects [[Belnades]] from the main hall, and they proceed to the Goldstrauss Bank. On their way, Kaldrake notices a shadow from the alley, asking if Belnades noticed it. This worries Belnades, who goes to investigate. They notice a sewer grate left open in the alley, and Belnades enters, despite Kaldrake's protests. After a couple minutes, Kaldrake hears Belnades scream from within the sewers. He enters, chasing after her, but notices the screams are from way further down the sewers than Belnades could have feasibly gone. Kaldrake drops one of the cursed rings to mark his path, and chases after the sounds. He soon comes across a figure standing over Belnades's unconscious body, wearing bounty hunter garb similar to [[Tobias Grand|Tobias's]]. The figure is carrying a hacksaw. Kaldrake hits him, pushing him into the water, continuing to hit him on the way down. He gets up, and Kaldrake sees he has no face. The figure slashes Kaldrake with a hacksaw, poisoning him, and Kaldrake knocks him unconscious, watching him float away in the sewer. Kaldrake takes Belnades's body back to the city, pleading for help, but due to her being a tiefling, nobody seems interested. To save Belnades, Kaldrake resets history again.

Kaldrake finds himself outside the sewers again, and hears Belnades call out that she had found the rebels. Kaldrake again descends into the sewers, following Belnades toward a crevice in the wall. However, while approaching it, Kaldrake notices a hook in the sewer. As he turns to enter the crevice, he is bitten in the leg and pulled back. Kaldrake sees a giant, hulking corpse flayer, who bites him again, blinding him. Kaldrake resets history again.

He now finds himself outside Gwyneth's manor, without Belnades. It's much later in the day, and he is still bloodied from the attack somehow. Kaldrake enters the manor, and finds nothing: no Bisco, no paintings, dusty walls, and a staircase where the magic elevator once was. Kaldrake proceeds to Gwyneth's room, and finds the pit open, with white fog instead of black. Kaldrake returns to the drawing room to find the djinn, but the painting is now of Gwyneth, and the secret area is not there. Kaldrake decides to jump into the pit in Gwyneth's room, now knowing it's a portal, and passes out. He dreams he is Gulvayas, in an ornate office filled with display cases. He notices he doesn't have the dagger on his person, but does still have the mask.
