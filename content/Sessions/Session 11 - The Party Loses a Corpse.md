### Logline
*Moiloc, Branwyn, and Brewster collect themselves after Kaldrake's death. Moiloc deepens her connection with Shurima. Meanwhile, the events in Brasov escalate, putting Dunn in danger.*
### Synopsis
On their way out of the Chateau, Moiloc encounters a nothic seemingly working for Shurima collecting Celestial books from the Chateau library. The group begin heading to Dunn with Kaldrake's corpse, and make a camp on their way, after seeing carriages with Cypha's flags on them heading toward Brasov. During the night, someone takes Kaldrake's corpse, and a large explosion emanates from Brasov. Kaldrake, Brewster, and Moiloc investigate the ruins of Brasov looking for Kaldrake, but are unable to find him, and instead return to Dunn after discovering Cypha's carriages may be heading that way. Kaldrake is revived as a result of Brasov's destruction, and rescues Goro, David, Skalazar, and Belnades from their imprisonment on the ship, returning to land with Jones, one of the guards, who remains with Kaldrake as a devout follower. Brewster, Moiloc, and Branwyn return to Dunn to find Shurima to be the person in the carriages, and watch as he kills all of his guards and somehow transforms the Resistance's dragon. Brewster finds King Endrio's cloak left behind. Kaldrake's group begins making their way to Fort Bosco. Moiloc finds armor left to her by Shurima, which take her to Shurima where he tells her about Mora and Branwyn's connection.
# Day 29
## The Chateau - Main Floor
[[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]], [[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]], and [[Lothar (Brewster) Nash|Brewster]] leave the Chateau basement with [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake's]] corpse, hoping someone at Dunn would be able to help. However, before leaving, Moiloc notices three-toed footprints leading from the freezer to the ladder leading back to the main floor. Following it, they notice that the bucket of milk they had moved to the side of the hatch had been knocked over, and milk is still trickling out, implying it was recent. Brewster notices the creature is likely heavy to make imprints that deep in the soil of the basement. He heals Moiloc and casts Sanctuary on Branwyn in preparation for whatever awaits them. Moiloc notices claw marks leading into the main floor's library, and as she approaches, feels breath on her neck as she hears [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] warn her not to enter. Branwyn notices Moiloc's reaction, and asks what happened. Moiloc says Shurima warns them not to enter, and enters the library by herself.

Moiloc notices the sound of scurrying, and shredded papers all over the room. The doors close behind her, and she senses Shurima's energy in the corner of the room. As she approaches, she sees a nothic, although she herself is unable to identify it as such. The nothic is wearing a backpack, and once the doors close, moves the the bookshelves, digging through them and putting some of the Celestial books in its pack. Moiloc reaches for the backpack, but the nothic hisses at her. Branwyn asks what is happening in the room, and Moiloc describes the nothic as a cyclops, hedgehog, and werewolf hybrid. Neither Brewster or Branwyn are able to identify it with this description, and Brewster tells Moiloc to grab some of the Celestial books for research. However, as she approaches, the nothic notices, and is again upset, rushing to grab the books first. With no way to communicate with the nothic or look into what books it is taking, the group leaves the Chateau.
## Forest
The trio recalls that [[Gorm|Gorm's]] group is raiding Brasov. They temporarily consider going to Brasov themselves to meet up with Gorm, but decide to prioritize returning Kaldrake's corpse to Dunn. However, on their way, they stop to hide as they notice a group of carriages approaching Brasov. There are five carriages, with the central one floating off the ground, and many guards in silver armor. Brewster notices flags of [[Queen Cypha]] on the carriages. The guards are elven, and Moiloc looks on in wonder, commenting that she hasn't seen an elf before, shocking Branwyn, especially after Kaldrake's death.

The group again considers going to Brasov to warn Gorm's group of the oncoming carriages, but decides against it due to the time of night, their wounds, and the speed of the carriages. Branwyn makes a travois to carry Kaldrake's corpse, and they continue out some ways, before stopping to rest. They decide to take shifts to watch over Kaldrake as the others rest.

Branwyn's shift is first, but doesn't notice anything eventful. During Brewster's shift, there is a deafening magical blue explosion from the direction of Brasov, able to be seen over the treetops and waking the others. At this point Moiloc takes her shift since she's already up, and also doesn't notice anything eventful. After this shift, the others get up, and Brewster notices that Kaldrake's corpse has disappeared. Branwyn sees humanoid boot tracks leading in the direction of Brasov from the camp, and suggests they go back to Brasov to collect Kaldrake's corpse. Moiloc agrees, and Brewster reluctantly follows.
# Day 30
## Brasov Ruins
The group could smell a singed, magical odor before they can even see Brasov, even this long after the explosion, so they knew the explosion must have been large. Upon reaching Brasov, they find it totally leveled. Where the town once was there is now debris, and vaguely corpse-shaped objects, whose identities would not be able to be discerned. Brewster and Branwyn notice gouges in the earth filled with ydril powder going around the perimeter of the town. Noticing the forest outside Brasov seems relatively unharmed, they question if this perimeter contained the explosion to just Brasov. Brewster worries about this, as if it were true, it would mean the enemy has immense magical capability, and that without this perimeter the explosion could have likely been much bigger.

Branwyn begins looking for Kaldrake, but does not see him in the city. She does, however, see a boat at sea, far enough out that it wouldn't have been affected by the explosion. She points this out to the others, believing Kaldrake could be on the boat, but it seems all boats which were docked had been destroyed in the explosion, so they can't reach the it. Wondering about the ydril circle containing the explosion, Brewster checks to see if the ydril circle somehow extends past the shoreline to complete the circle, but finds that the circle is actually open facing the water, explaining why the boat might be further out than the radius of the explosion would imply. He also finds a locked box on the shore, which he takes with him.

Brewster goes to where [[Jessie Harkness|Jessie's]] bar used to be, and digs around trying to find the tunnel that led to Dunn. Moiloc goes to Michael's, believing [[Monty MacMasters|Monty]] may have been there. Moiloc finds a chest containing leather gauntlets and 200 gold pieces, and brings it to Brewster to identify. Brewster notices the name Monty McMasters is embroidered on the wrist, and asks who he is. Moiloc says he's trustworthy and an ally, Branwyn says he shouldn't be trusted. Knowing Moiloc's trust in Shurima, Brewster is also hesitant to trust Monty on only her suggestion.

Branwyn finds a rowboat further down the shore, a bit outside of the explosion's radius, but after discussing with the others can't find a safe plan to approach the boat since the group has no idea what awaits them, and ditches the plan to row to the larger boat. Moiloc finds wheel tracks leading out of the city heading toward Dunn. Brewster points out that Gorm doesn't use wheeled transportation, and worries that the carriages from before may now be making their way toward Dunn to do the same thing they did to Brasov. Not finding much else in the ruins, the group uses Jessie's tunnel to return to Dunn, and warn them about what's coming.
## The High Pontate
Kaldrake wakes up on a boat, wearing traveler's clothes. He recognizes that he is in the captain's quarters. Looking outside a window to the room, he sees Inquisitors and knights from Lothric, the capital of Wallachia. He also sees a map in the room, with a pin about ten miles from the shore, meaning he likely can't escape by swimming. Looking out the window he can see the shore, but can't see any buildings despite the map showing they should be near Brasov. Kaldrake looks through a chest in the room, and finds his armor, but no shield, and the armor is tattered and beyond use.
Kaldrake exits the room, and talks to the [[Jones|guard]] at the door, who seems nervous when talking to him. Noticing the guard is basically shaking, Kaldrake attempts to calm his nerves by telling him he won't hurt him, but that seems to make the guard's fear worse. Kaldrake also tries to tell the guard to just call him Kaldrake, and not "sir," but the guard stands firm, saying since Kaldrake is a Sootspot, it's only right.

The guard tells Kaldrake the ship is called the High Pontate, and that [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth]] took him to the ship but has since left. He also explains that they have declared war against Amaris. Kaldrake points out that Montrissad has already been destroyed, so there isn't much point in a war, but the guard says free land is free land. The guard also mentions that they cleansed Brasov of the heathens, killing all of them. Kaldrake asks for more information about his sister, and the guard says she's the new Grand Vizier, advising the army on magic and helping with the creation of magic laws. Kaldrake asks who is in charge, and the guard shakily tells here that would be [[Arklow Laban]], who is in the lower decks with the prisoners.

Kaldrake finds Arklow, who is fully decorated in military medals. Kaldrake asks for more information on Gwyneth, and Arklow informs him that she has returned to Lothric. Noting his medals, Kaldrake asks Arklow about his military history, and he proudly tells stories of all of the terrible things he has done. Kaldrake then asks about how he was revived. Arklow laughs this off at first, saying it's not a big deal, and that he had died fourteen times already. Usually someone just hires a priest on his behalf and the priest dies instead, but Kaldrake was a more difficult resurrection, requiring the sacrifice of all of Brasov to revive. They fed the souls of Brasov to a djinn they had trapped in a box, and the djinn granted them the wish of Kaldrake's resurrection. The order to revive Kaldrake came from someone above even Gwyneth, so he is very important in their plans.

On his way back to the main deck, Kaldrake sees [[Goro Hattori|Goro]] in one of the cells. Kaldrake apologizes, but Goro says none of this was his gault. Kaldrake admits that he killed [[Father Gregor]], so he still feels somewhat responsible. Goro isn't as happy to hear that, but still says Kaldrake shouldn't feel responsible. He notes that Gwyneth has changed since her time working in Montrissad. Goro also points out where [[Belnades]], [[Skalazar]], and [[David]] are imprisoned. Kaldrake asks where [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] is, and Goro tells him that Lexar died defending them. Kaldrake tells Goro that he believes Lexar abandoned him during his time with the Inquisitors. Kaldrake also asks where [[King Aslan]] is, and Goro informs him that [[Lortzgab]] was able to complete the teleportation circle, but was only able to take King Aslan at the last moment.

Kaldrake expresses that he wants to help them, and Goro says he likely just needs to ask Arklow to take them. Since Kaldrake is a Sootspot, he'll probably just let him. Kaldrake asks Arklow, and he lets them free. Kaldrake and the four prisoners return to the guard. Kaldrake introduces everyone, and the guard introduces himself as Jones. Kaldrake then takes Jones's armor and shield, but lets him keep his spear. He tells Jones to come with him, and that he is saving his friends. Jones expresses some confusion over why Kaldrake would want to save non-humans, and Kaldrake tells him to stop talking and follow orders. Kaldrake tells Jones that he sees himself in him, with his cowering and fear, and wants to save him as well from life serving under Arklow.

Jones changes into sailor clothes now that he doesn't have his armor, and begins to lower one of the rescue boats into the water. Kaldrake, Jones, Goro, Belnades, Skalazar, and David all sail back to the shore of Wallachia. The reuniting between Belnades and Kaldrake is very awkward, as Belnades still holds some resentments against Kaldrake for his actions. On their way to shore, Kaldrake asks Jones what happened when his corpse was taken, trying to learn if his friends are okay after the fight at the Chateau, but Jones is unsure of the description of the people they took Kaldrake's corpse from. Kaldrake asks if they took him from Dunn, and Jones says that everyone in Dunn should already be dead as well.

Upon getting to the shore, Kaldrake takes Jones's map, and asks what the best way to Lothric would be, trying to find Dunn. Jones mentions Fort Bosco might be a good place to get horses and other materials for their travels. Getting a little annoyed by Jones's fear but also near-idolization of Kaldrake, Kaldrake tells him to go back to the ship, but saying after he does that he is freed from duty. Jones promises to fulfill his dreams once he is free.
## Dunn
Upon reaching Dunn, Kaldrake, Brewster, and Moiloc see the caravan is right on their tail, also almost at Dunn. The trio rush to Dunn to warn them of Cypha's army, but find that Dunn has already been deserted. Brewster mentions that the Resistance is likely long gone, as they disassemble and leave camp as soon as they get word that their location is in any way compromised. In preparation for a possible upcoming attack, Brewster gives Moiloc the Braeton shield from the Chateau and takes her old shield for himself.

Brewster and Branwyn realize the Resistance's dragon, [[Ouroborus Tikktal]], likely wasn't able to be taken with the rest of the Resistance on such short notice, and continue into the cave to see what remains. Brewster stops by his lab in the cave, seeing it has been fully emptied, before continuing to the dragon's den as Branwyn keeps watch. The dragon is still there, sleeping. Brewster wakes her, and she loudly chastises him for doing so, causing Brewster to shush her to keep her hidden from the carriages. This further upsets Ouroboros, who speaks of her ancient, incomprehensible power and wisdom. Brewster explains that the carriages are approaching and she is in danger as Branwyn enters, having heard the dragon. However, Ouroboros tells them not to waste time trying to free her from the constraints and follow the Resistance, who moved forward plans and are heading to Lothric. Unable to find a way to free the dragon from the ydril-infused chains, Brewster and Branwyn return to the nearby brush to hide and watch the caravan.

Then the carriages stop at the entrance to the cave, humans in silver armor with the one-winged crow, the symbol of Cypha's reign, imprinted on them. Two guards place satchels at the cave's entrance, shout something in Celestial, and the satchels explode, widening the entrance. The floating carriage opens, and Shurima exits. Recognizing him, Moiloc tells the others who he is. Brewster worries that Shurima will be able to sense Moiloc, giving away their location. Moiloc attempts to communicate with him using their connection, and he turns to the group's hiding location and shushes her. Branwyn is also concerned about Shurima knowing their location, saying someone here is being played, and questioning if it's them or the soldiers. Shurima and the human soldiers enter the cave.

After a few minutes, blood-curdling screams are heard from the cave. A few more minutes later, Shurima exits the cave, holding two of the chains which were keeping Ouroboros chained to the cave walls, using them as a leash to lead the dragon out. Her wings are now bound to her sides. The elven guards remove their helmets and bow to Shurima. Arcs of energy drain from the guards, and the energy begins swarming around Shurima. The guards drop dead, and the ydril-infused chains begin to glow. Ouroboros's scales begin to glow with magic, turning grey, then black. The dragon collapses, unmoving, as Shurima continues to glow with magic, before suddenly disappearing.

Branwyn and Brewster look to Branwyn for any reaction, but she seems to not know how to respond either. Brewster approaches Ouroborus, putting his hand on her snout to investigate. Suddenly, her eyes open, and she rises up. The group sees the dragon is now blind, and as she takes a deep breath and does not exhale, they realize she may not need to breathe any more either. She spreads her wings, which are now much larger, and flies off.

Brewster continues into the cave, which is covered in viscera. It seems the guards which entered the cave with Shurima were dismembered beyond recognition. Brewster inspects the gore and finds various pointed vampire teeth. Continuing into the dragon's den, Brewster sees that all of the dragon's treasure is gone, except for one chest in the corner which is too heavy for Brewster to move. There are snapped fragments of chain still welded within the wall.

Brewster returns outside, where Branwyn is watering the carriage horses. Brewster asks Branwyn to attempt to unlock the chest he found on the shore of Brasov, and she is unable to open it. Moiloc attempts to smash the lock off, and hurts herself on the first hit, but is able to eventually get it open. Inside the chest is a cloudy white crystal. Brewster recognizes the crystal's magic, and says the crystal requires a passphrase, but may teleport its user somewhere. He also recognizes the sigil of house Laban, a profile image of a man in a hat.

Brewster then asks Moiloc to follow him into the cave to see if she can bust open the chest in the dragon's den too. He first warns her on what she's about to see, and she asks him to lead her to it with her eyes closed. He does a terrible job at leading her through, and she steps on a lot of gore, but makes it to the chest with her eyes closed. She bashes it open, but before Brewster opens it Moiloc asks him to lead her out. He does so, about as well as he did the first time, before returning to the chest and opening it. He immediately recognizes [[King Endrio the Bold|King Endrio's]] cloak. This cloak was originally meant to inspire hope in Endrio's citizens and warriors, and is an important historical artifact. Brewster makes sure to carefully hold it and hold it above the gore to keep it pristine on its way out.

Branwyn looks through the carriages, and doesn't find anything in the regular ones, besides one drained corpse with Cypha's sigil. Brewster uses a chest in one of these carriages to store Endrio's cloak. She worries about what could be in the magical carriage, wondering if it could be trapped. Brewster tries to open it, and senses that it also won't operate without a passphrase, so Branwyn moves on to burning the bodies that were still intact. Brewster asks Moiloc if she knows, with her connection to Shurima, and she approaches the carriage, says Shurima's name to the door, and it opens.

Inside the carriage is a corpse in black plate armor. The armor is in perfect condition, but seems to have been cobbled together using various other pieces of armor. Brewster recognizes the helmet: a mask and headdress, but the mask seems to depict someone that Brewster recognizes from his research, but he can't pinpoint who. There is a cobra on the forehead of the mask. Brewster is very suspicious of all of this, but Moiloc asks if he can identify if there is any magic attuned to the armor. Brewster says he'll agree to identify it if Moiloc touches the armor first. She does so, and immediately begins to feel like the armor was made for her.

Brewster sees Moiloc seemed to be fine, but her reaction still makes him wary, so he casts Identify through [[Puck Nash|Puck]] by having Puck touch the armor. He learns that the armor was created using a wish spell. It is the Plate Armor of the Snake Emperor. It has four charges which can be used to Create Undead, Inflict Wounds, Branding Smite, or Searing Smite. He does also detect a curse on the armor that would affect those who don't follow Shurima, which is common on artifacts from minor gods. After telling Moiloc this, she puts on the armor, and disappears, like Shurima did.
## Forest
While they walk to Fort Bosco, Kaldrake tries to reconnect with Belnades, whose horns have begun to grow back, and whose eyepatch is worse than the one provided by the Inquisitors. Kaldrake apologizes, taking responsibility for the situation. Belnades agrees that it was his fault, and that he left her to die. Kaldrake says Violet was very convincing, but that the Inquisitors are wrong, and she won't help them. Belnades says she's not with them anymore. The pair agree that Kaldrake is a pushover, and Belnades can't forgive Kaldrake yet for leaving her to be executed. They bond a little bit while Kaldrake tells Belnades how he died.

On their way, Jones reappears, saying that now that he is free he has decided to help Kaldrake with his mission. His morals, however, still seem aligned, saying he wants revenge on the non-humans (which he calls "non-humies") because they killed his uncle, who was invading the Orkus Badlands. Jones had also killed his adopted goblin brother, but says he deserved it for trying to kill his mom. As night falls, the group sets up camp for the night.
## Shurima's Room
Moiloc appears in a castle, and smells food. Shurima is at a desk at the other side of the room with a charcuterie board. He provides her with lore.

Shurima provides armor to all of his avatars, it's a set of armor from when he was a king. He also refuses to tell Moiloc anything about the dragon. He seems upset that Moiloc is divulging secrets, and Moiloc says her party is beginning to get upset about her secrecy. Shurima asks Moiloc if she knows who her friends truly are, mentioning Branwyn is a daughter of Mora.

He stops at this point, asking if Moiloc knows about Mora. She says no, and he tells her that she has to promise not to tell Branwyn, as he fears the consequences of her learning the truth. Moiloc initially says that she'll tell her if she needs to know, but Shurima says there's no situation where she'd need to know unless it's already too late and she's dead. Moiloc says she agrees, and Shurima makes her sign a contract. Moiloc questions if she should know this information at all, but in the pursuit of secrets signs the contract.

Mora is an avatar of Maokai, but they had a falling out after the desecration of Gravewatch, where a necromancer turned the whole forest to dead wood. Mora went crazy with power in the name of vengeance, and even though Maokai said the death of the forest was natural, Mora killed the necromancer, his wife, and his baby son. But she wanted more, so she vowed to get revenge on all who harm nature. She made a deal with the Forgotten One and assaulted the civilized world, but her power came at a price. Her body cannot contain the power bestowed to her by the Forgotten One, and her form is withering. So she kidnaps and indoctrinates girls to serve as her vessels - implanting memories, ripping their souls from them, and inhabiting their bodies. Shurima stresses the importance of not telling Branwyn, since from her point of view, Mora saved her from her father. Moiloc asks if Mora can be stopped, and Shurima says she's far too powerful for them. Shurima tells Moiloc she's on the right path for now, though.
## Dunn
During Moiloc's absence, Brewster Identifies the gauntlets from Monty as Gauntlets of Skullduggery which may improve sleight of hand, and the boots from the seaside box as boots of Misty Step. Moiloc re-appears, and the others question her on what happened, but she doesn't tell them much of anything. The group sets up camp for the night in the nearby forest.
