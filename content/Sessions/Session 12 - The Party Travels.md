### Logline
*The groups encounter obstacles on their way to Lothric, and are made to remember their roots.*
### Synopsis
On their way to Lothric, Branwyn and Brewster are called to one of Mora's hidden cabins. It seems identical to Branwyn's childhood home, and after fighting a snoutkai, Branwyn finds a corpse that looks identical to herself as a child. David leaves Kaldrake's group, but he continues to Fort Bosco with Jones, Belnades, and Goro. On their way, they are attacked by a treant. Moiloc finds a mirror which gives her visions of home. Moiloc, Branwyn, and Brewster are attacked by yeth hounds. Brewster crosses paths with Gorm on his shift driving the carriage, but Gorm seems off, and Brewster is made to forget the encounter. The trio arrive at Lothric, and Kaldrake's group arrives at Fort Bosco, as night falls. Kaldrake has a vision of Martin chained up to the moon, and notices his heart is no longer beating.
# Day 31
## Dunn
[[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] wakes up to discover she is not wearing the armor [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima]] gave her, despite not remembering taking it off. She realizes that the armor turns invisible when the helmet is removed. [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] wakes up and notices that the appearance of the forest surrounding Dunn has changed. She points this out to [[Lothar (Brewster) Nash|Brewster]], who says that he doesn't see any treants. The changed forest panics Branwyn, who says the group should leave. Brewster is hesitant to leave Dunn, since although the trees have changed, Dunn is exactly as it was when they went to sleep, to a tee, and he worries that entering the changed forest will sew trouble. However, with staying in Dunn forever not being an option, the group hurriedly loads the caravan and takes a horse, and Moiloc rides the group toward Lothric.
## Forest
Soon after entering the forest, Branwyn's bite wound begins to ache. Soon after, a second wave of pain washes over her, and she starts calling for the carriage to be pulled over, saying she can't breathe. Brewster relays the message to Moiloc, who stops the carriage, and Branwyn throws herself into the forest. Branwyn finds herself able to breathe again, and smells smoke coming from somewhere in the forest.

Moiloc sees that Branwyn's wound has opened up, and asks to see it. Branwyn shows the pair her shoulder, and the wound appears fresh, and the flesh around it is beginning to blacken. Brewster remarks that he hasn't seen anything like this before, and Moiloc tries to use her abilities to sense for any nearby danger, but is unable to find anything. However, she does sense some sort of fiendish energy from the wound.

Branwyn, thinking this may be related to Mora, begins to look in the book [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth]] made on Mora to see if she can find anything on what is happening. She does find a note mentioning that one of Mora's cottages are in the area. Branwyn asks Brewster if she can use [[Puck Nash|Puck]] to forge a magical compass that can lead her to Mora. Brewster agrees, and starts helping her get Puck set up for the ritual, as Branwyn asks Moiloc to find a feather. Moiloc walks off, throws a hand axe at a wild bird, plucks some bloody feathers from it, and begins to walk back to Branwyn, but can't find her way to them.

Moiloc calls out for Branwyn, and Branwyn hears this, but Brewster does not. Branwyn and Moiloc continue to call out to each other, but their ability to hear each other seems to be diminishing quickly. Soon, Moiloc and Branwyn can't hear each other at all. Brewster realizes he has a feather in his component pouch, and hands it to Branwyn for the ritual, and the pair begin to follow it. Brewster makes an attempt to keep Branwyn in his line of sight in case he is also disconnected from Branwyn.

Meanwhile, Moiloc feels Shurima's presence again. Not seeing any sign of her teammates, she returns to Dunn to wait for them.
## Mora's Cabin
For Branwyn and Brewster, it is getting dark quickly. Brewster calls attention to this odd passage of time, and Branwyn comments that it's normal. She doesn't go into the possibility that this is connected to [[Mora]]. After following the compass for some time, the pair arrive at a burnt cabin. Branwyn recognizes that this cabin looks identical to the cabin that she grew up in, and rushes to enter. At the doorstep of the cabin is the corpse of an adult humanoid with bark skin, although neither are able to collect any information on them.

The pair enter the cabin, and Branwyn notices that it truly is exactly like her old cabin: everything is accounted for, although the building is a ransacked mess. Brewster examines an alchemist's table and a bookshelf, although most of the items seem to be pretty restricted to common magic. Branwyn looks at a pot sitting in the fireplace, seeing deep gouges in the ceramic. With nothing else to see, Branwyn continues toward the door to the bedroom.

However, as she approaches, the pair hear a shriek. Brewster, standing by the bookshelf, is suddenly blinded, as he hears something behind him licking its lips. Branwyn turns to see a snoutkai behind Brewster, creating a green fog that makes her gag, and she prepares to attack.

> [!danger] Fight
> Not knowing where the monster is, Brewster casts Sanctuary on himself. Brewster shoots the snoutkai, causing it to turn away from Brewster and slash Branwyn. Brewster tries to help by casting Faerie Fire, but it only affects Branwyn, putting her at a disadvantage against the snoutkai. Branwyn uses her Boots of Misty Step to teleport away and shoot the snoutkai again. The snoutkai moves in to bite her again. Brewster begins to regain his vision. Seeing Branwyn is the only one glowing, he revokes Faerie Fire and uses Poison Spray on the snoutkai as Branwyn uses her hand axe to hit it as well. The snoutkai, angry, bites Branwyn, and seems to be attempting to eat a part of her. Brewster recognizes that this may restore some vitality to the monster, and shoots it with poison again, killing it.

Brewster gives Branwyn the two healing potions he had prepared, and she drinks them. Brewster moves to investigate the monster. It seems to be a rotting mash of a spider, bear, and pig, its mouth filled with teeth and rot. It is clearly unnatural. He asks Branwyn to fill him in on what is happening, and she tells him some information.

Branwyn was raised by Mora, a witch, and was raised in a cabin like the one they are currently in. For all she knows, it could be the same cabin. She says that some oddities can be expected from Mora, but this monster and the fire are beyond anything she's seen before. Brewster, a little upset that everyone in his new party seems to be hiding connections to beings of terrible magic power, asks if everyone in their group has these connections. Branwyn comments that [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]]probably didn't, and Brewster mentions that Kaldrake is dead. This causes Branwyn to snap, so Brewster backs off.

Branwyn continues into the back bedroom. Brewster follows to ensure he doesn't lose Branwyn like Moiloc did, but keeps his distance as she explores the space. Branwyn sees two legs sticking out from the bed, and pulls out the corpse of a child which looks identical to Branwyn's six-year-old self. There is an identical bite mark on the child's shoulder as well. Further under the bed is a small tome, which the child seems to have been hiding. It is a leather journal with most of its pages ripped out, and seems to be blank, providing no information.

Brewster sees this as well, and can't help but investigate. Branwyn tells him about being a green dreamer and about her wound, hoping it would help Brewster's investigation, but he doesn't recognize anything of use from the information. However, he mentions a friend, [[Daphne]], who he had to leave behind when he escaped enslavement, and mentions that she may be able to help confirm if this child is really Branwyn, or something else. He takes a lock of hair from both versions of Branwyn in case he meets her again, and Branwyn takes the child and the bark-skinned corpse, wraps them, and cremates them.

After some time, Brewster hesitantly asks Branwyn how they leave. Branwyn says if they move with intention, focusing on where they want to end up, they should be able to arrive there. The two focus on the carriages they left behind, and reappear there.
## Forest
Kaldrake wakes up to [[Jones]] cooking beans. He sees [[Goro Hattori|Goro]] and [[David]] talking, and attempts to join them, but Jones notices Kaldrake has woken up and excitedly speaks to him. Jones mentions that Goro and David had hunted some deer, but since Jones is vegan, he had to make some beans instead. Kaldrake spends a short time talking to Jones, learning that Fort Bosco is about two days away, but Jones quickly returns to his problematic past, saying non-humans are only good to be slaves. Kaldrake says anyone can be a slave, attempting to bring some sense of racial equality to the conversation, but it only confuses Jones into wondering if he is Kaldrake's slave, a situation he seems to be fine with.

Kaldrake eventually is able to escape the conversation, and notices David leaving his conversation with Goro, walking into the woods. Kaldrake asks Goro what happened, and he says David is leaving to find his husband. He tells Kaldrake that he has business with Gwyneth, so he has no plans on leaving the group.

Kaldrake checks on [[Belnades]], who is meditating. Kaldrake makes his presence known, and Belnades stops meditating to talk with Kaldrake. Kaldrake fills Belnades in on where he plans on going, mentioning that Gwyneth is the new grand vizier, which surprises Belnades. She says there hasn't been one in fifteen years, and is interested in staying with Kaldrake's group to find out why there's been a sudden change in position. Kaldrake gives Belnades a sword to defend herself as they proceed. Good thing, too, as soon after leaving camp, the group is attacked by a treant.

> [!danger] Fight
> Kaldrake chops at the treant with his axe, and Jones stabs it with his spear. Belnades swings with her new sword, but misses. Kaldrake also misses his next four attacks, and the treant takes the opportunity to slam itself down onto Kaldrake, who is luckily able to dodge the attacks. Jones gets another hit in, as does Belnades, and the treant reacts by slamming onto Belnades successfully, then onto Kaldrake unsuccessfully. Kaldrake ripostes and hits the tree again, but misses his basic attack.
> 
> Belnades, getting a handle on the sword, gets another hit in, and the tree slams down on Kaldrake, twice. Kaldrake misses his riposte, and Jiren and Belnades also miss their attacks. The tree slams down on Kaldrake again, twice. This is enough to down Kaldrake. Belnades rushes to him, taking a hit on the way, but is able to heal and stabilize Kaldrake. As a consequence, the tree downs Belnades instead. Kaldrake hits the treant with a distracting strike, distracting it, and taking its next hit. Kaldrake responds by chopping the treant down. Jones stabilizes Belnades, who heals herself.
## Dunn
Moiloc decides to look around Dunn some more while waiting for Brewster and Branwyn. She stumbles across a cellar hatch in one of the ruined buildings, and feels a cool breeze from the underlying space upon opening it. The hole looks to be very deep, and Moiloc is able to determine it is about 50 feet by dropping a torch down the hole. She descends the ladder, as the atmosphere grows colder, and descends into a large cavern, with a mirror in its corner stretching from floor to ceiling. There are runes on the mirror's frame which Moiloc is unable to identify.

Moiloc touches the mirror, and sees the castle halls through the mirror. She sees [[Jefferson]], her family's dwarf butler, and is filled with memories of home. She thinks of Branwyn, and the image in the mirror shifts to a forest. Thinking of Kaldrake, the mirror goes black. Thinking of [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], she sees Montrissad, burning. Thinking of Shurima, she sees a broken pillar in the desert. Finally, thinking of [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]] shows a bear rehabilitation camp. As she goes to turn away, Moiloc feels the mirror pull on her. She is able to resist the mirror's call to touch it, and returns to the carriages, where she finds Brewster and Branwyn. The group fills each other in on what happened since they were separated.

Branwyn's wound seems to have healed since returning. Brewster has an idea to check for writing indentation on the journal Branwyn found, and lightly rubbing a pencil on the first non-torn page revealed an entry where Mora taught the child how to make soup. With no additional leads, the group continues on their journey. They decide to take a quick stop at Brasov upon passing it, and note that the ship at sea was still there.
## Forest
In the forest, Branwyn, Moiloc, and Brewster coms across a pack of three yeth hounds.

> [!danger] Fight
> Moiloc activates her fire sword. Brewster casts Web on the hounds, and is able to capture one, but it soon escapes. The other yeth hounds attack Moiloc and Brewster, but miss. Branwyn is able to shoot one, and Moiloc casts Vow of Enmity and smites the yeth hound as well. Brewster dispels Web to cast Flaming Sphere on the hound that attacked him, and is able to burn the hound, but misses his Poison Spray follow-up. The hound walks away to escape the flames. The last, now-freed hound attacks Brewster as well, but misses. The hound that left Brewster turns to Branwyn, but she shoots it before it can get to her. Brewster takes the opportunity to heal, and moves the flaming sphere to the hound which is now attacking him.
> 
> Trying to escape, Branwyn uses her Misty Step boots to move to the top of the carriage, shooting the hounds from higher ground. One hound tries to hop onto the carriage as well, but falls off and dies. One of the remaining hounds shrieks in response to this, frightening Moiloc and Brewster, who try and flee from their respective hounds. As Moiloc runs away, she throws one of her hand axes at the hound. Puck rams into the hound attacking Brewster, and the hound which was attacking Moiloc turns back to Brewster, biting him. Branwyn shoots the hound, killing it, as Brewster retaliates by moving the flaming sphere to the final hound. Moiloc finishes it off by beheading it with her sword.
## Fort Bosco
Meanwhile, Kaldrake's group is continuing toward Fort Bosco after their fight with the treant. After trying to get a timeline on Gwyneth's location down with Goro, Kaldrake decides to settle down outside Fort Bosco and rest for the night before entering.

While sleeping Kaldrake experiences a vision. He feels like he is drowning, and opening his eyes, he notices he is floating in the night sky. Looking around he sees the moon, realizing that he is in fact floating in space. On the surface of the moon is a dome, and inside is [[Martin Sootspot]], chained to the moon's surface. Kaldrake suddenly feels dead, and notices his heart isn't beating. In fact, Kaldrake notices a gaping hole where his heart should be. The hole fills with a brilliant red light, and Kaldrake wakes up in pain. The pain soon subsides, but Kaldrake notices that he doesn't have a heartbeat anymore.

Kaldrake asks Belnades to feel for his heartbeat, and the absence of one concerns her. Kaldrake tells Belnades about the djinn which supposedly revived him, and Belnades says that shouldn't be possible for a djinn, and that [[Arklow Laban|Arklow]] must be lying to him. Kaldrake notes the needs of the group, and decides that in the morning he will enter Fort Bosco with just Jones, since the other aren't humans and wouldn't be received well. Although Kaldrake isn't a human, Jones implied that they should be willing to help a Sootspot.
## Forest
Branwyn, Brewster, and Moiloc continue on their journey, taking shifts through the night so they can keep progressing while sleeping. After some time, Brewster notices a shirtless [[Gorm]] walking the other direction. Brewster offers for Gorm to join them on the carriage, but he insists they continue without him. Brewster notices something is off, there are purple cracks in Gorm's face, and he isn't blinking. However, since Gorm refuses to join them, Brewster has no choice but to continue. Soon after, Brewster forgets he saw Gorm at all, similarly to how Gertrude forgot meeting people outside the burning Hatched Pig's Inn.

At around 11pm, the group arrives at Lothric, a floating castle atop a black rock island. At the base of the city is a shanty town, lit by torches and scattered with townsfolk. They decide to wait until morning to enter the city.
