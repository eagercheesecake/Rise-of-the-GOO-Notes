### Logline
Kaldrake rewrites history. Branwyn and Brewster find a familiar monster in the sewers of Lothric. Moiloc searches for the Resistance.
### Synopsis
Kaldrake receives a vision of a drow named Gulvayas killing Martin and his father, awakening to find that reality has changed. He awakens to find he has arrived at Lothric, and he enters with Belnades. They proceed to Gwyneth's manor to meet with her. Moiloc continues to explore the city looking for the Resistance, and explores the Goldstrauss Bank. Branwyn and Brewster find corpse flayers in the sewers under Lothric, and eventually find a safe way back to the surface, where they reunite with Moiloc before bathing. While bathing, Moiloc discovers the shadowy figure following them is a spirit sent by Shurima, and she commands it to tell them how to proceed. It is able to provide an image of the Resistance's hideout, and Moiloc, Brewster, and Branwyn enter the secret passage within the house in the vision, finally reuniting with the Resistance.
# Day 32
## Forest
After some time travelling to Lothric, [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]] notices they seem to be travelling faster than they should be. They have advanced much farther than they should have in the time it has taken, but it doesn't feel like the horses are going faster than they should. Kaldrake attempts to ask [[Belnades]] about this, twice, but forgets his question both times. He then notices that there is a glowing aura around everyone in his group, and all of their skin goes gray. Kaldrake speaks Belnades's name to ask her if she's noticing this, and she disappears from the horse. Kaldrake tries to stop the horse to investigate, but feels no resistance when pulling on the reins, as if there is no horse. Kaldrake calls out again, this time to the whole group, and everyone else disappears as well, leaving Kaldrake alone with the horses. Kaldrake speaks his own name, and realizes that he is not speaking in his own voice, but a voice a little deeper, as he also disappears.
# Day ???
## Forest
Kaldrake re-appears in what seems to be the same place, but in the midst of winter. His prior armor has disappeared, and he is only wearing tattered rags. Everything in the world has the same magical sheen that had enveloped his travelling group. He notices a string extending from his heart back into the distance, and also notices that he is able to feel his heartbeat again. As he tugs on the string, the world around him spins backward, pulling him closer to the other end of the string, which seems to be attached to the inside of a wagon. Driving the wagon on horseback is an elderly elf.

Kaldrake approaches the elf, who is concerned that Kaldrake isn't wearing warm clothing. As Kaldrake attempts to introduce himself, although he tries to say his own name, it comes out as "[[Gulvayas Hakon|Gulvayas]]." The elf points Kaldrake to the wagon in the back, saying he seems to be a similar size to his son, [[Martin Sootspot|Martin]], so the clothing they have back there may fit him. He warns Kaldrake to be quiet, as Martin is sleeping off a sickness in the back.

Kaldrake enters the wagon and changes into warmer clothes. While changing, he notices that the body he occupies, Gulvayas, is a drow. He also notices the imprints of chains on his wrists and ankles. Inside the clothing chest he finds a white mask, the same one [[Lothar (Brewster) Nash|Brewster]] had been trying to use in Lothric. He puts it on, and his skin tone reverts to Kaldrake's elven color. Gulvayas's body moves on its own, against Kaldrake's will, and pockets the mask, reverting back to Gulvayas's regular form.

Kaldrake begins to gain some of Gulvayas's memories. Gulvayas seems to be going to the Aether to learn magic. Gulvayas, again against Kaldrake's will, pulls out a bejeweled dagger, donning the sigil of the Sootspot family. However, with Gulvayas's memories, Kaldrake realizes Gulvayas knows this sigil as belonging to the Hakon family. When thinking about his family, Gulvayas recalls pain, suffering, and the feeling of cold stone. Finally, Gulvayas also notices a tome in the chest, seemingly belonging to Martin. Gulvayas pockets this tome as well. At this point, Kaldrake has almost fully lost control of this form.

Gulvayas approaches Martin with the dagger. Kaldrake is momentarily able to take control, yelling to stop, but neither elf seems to notice. Gulvayas stabs Martin, and watches the life drain from his eyes. Kaldrake recalls the elf he had killed in Fort Bosco. Gulvayas proceeds to the front of the wagon, climbing out and approaching the elderly elf. Kaldrake again is unable to warn him this time, as Gulvayas smiles, stabbing him. The elderly elf falls off the horse, and Gulvayas takes the reins, feeling a sense of calm envelop him.
# Day 26
## Shoreline
[[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] is not on the ship, and the Inquisitors quickly board the Wavecrasher. [[Lortzgab]] is able to complete her teleportation circle, and escapes with [[King Aslan]], although they are both captured soon after. The others on the ship are also captured.
# Day 29
## Forest
[[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] recalls that she has seen elves before - a large elven family lived in her home city.
# Day 31
## Brasov Ruins
While investigating the destroyed Brasov, Brewster notices the ydril circle surrounding Brasov is fully closed on all sides, including on the shoreline. The group proceeds to Dunn through the secret tunnel in [[Jessie Harkness|Jessie's]] destroyed bar.
## The High Pontate
Kaldrake wakes up on the High Pontate after being killed by a vampire. [[Arklow Laban]] gives him a letter from [[Gwyneth Sootspot|Gwyneth]], asking Kaldrake to meet her at Lothric. Kaldrake gathers [[Goro Hattori|Goro]], Belnades, [[David]], and [[Skalazar]] from the prison barge, and leaves the ship. Soon after, on land, they meet an Inquisitor named Jones, who notices Kaldrake is a Sootspot and provides them with horses and other items which will help them on their travels. He says Gwyneth had sent him, however [[Jones]] himself does not join them on their journey. They proceed straight from the High Pontate to Lothric.
## Dunn
Brewster, Moiloc, and [[Branwyn of Coryphea|Branwyn]] arrive at Dunn to find [[Ouroborus Tikktal|Ouroborus]], and the rest of the Resistance, gone. They find [[Shurima the Corpsemaker|Shurima's]] carriage, and a few others, left behind.
## Forest
Brewster does not have his forgotten interaction with [[Gorm]] while driving the carriage through the forest at night.
# Day 32
## Lothric
Branwyn and Brewster follow a baker who took their magical mask into a bakery. They attempt to retrieve it, but when their story causes one of the bakers to leave to get an Inquisitor to help them, they react and kill him before he is able to leave. The other baker, panics, and they have to kill him as well. They grab the bag containing the mask, and escape into the sewers. Brewster uses Invisibility, but Branwyn is seen during her escape by some Inquisitors who follow. They are able to shake them off with Spike Growth. Branwyn is seen by the Inquisitors, but only while hooded, so they do not get a look at her face.

Meanwhile, Moiloc finds a bounty board after leaving the Cathedral. On the board is a wanted poster for [[Violet]]. [[Tobias Grand|Tobias]] tells her of his Guild. Seeing an opportunity to ask for the rebels' whereabouts without raising suspicion, Moiloc takes the poster.
## Slums
Kaldrake wakes up from his vision as Gulvayas, finding they have arrived at Lothric. Goro is at his side, shaking him awake. Kaldrake asks how long he had been out, wondering how they had arrived so quickly, and Goro informs him he had only been asleep for about a half hour. Kaldrake questions a lot of this. The nearby trees are maple instead of pine, and most notably, he is able to feel his heartbeat again, but everyone seems to not remember any of what Kaldrake is saying is different. Goro explains what happened on the Wavecrasher and High Pontate, and Kaldrake is unable to reconcile why his memories are different. He also notices that while the timeline seems to match up, more or less, it is now winter, instead of fall. He leaves Goro and Skalazar in the slums, being non-humans. Belnades, wearing Inquisitor gear, feels like she would be able to enter safely by Kaldrake's side, and says she wants to find the Resistance, joining Kaldrake as he enters the town.
## Sewers
Brewster and Branwyn find they are lost in the sewers after running from the Inquisitors. They head downstream, hoping the sewers let out at the river by the entrance to Lothric. Since they are hoping to end up in the gold district, this seems like the right direction. Brewster checks the pack he stole from the bakers, and finds citizenship papers for Dave Baker, 25 gold, bread, and commoner's clothes.

Not too far down the sewers, Branwyn hears a wet slapping sound on the stone coming from behind them. Turning around, it seems to be too far away to see in the dark. Branwyn is familiar with a few beasts that could be lurking in the sewers, and not wanting a part of any of them, informs Brewster that they need to leave, fast. A bit further down the tunnel, they find a sewer grate, but something seems to be on top of it, and they are unable to open it, so they hurriedly proceed further into the sewers. Branwyn begins to hyperventilate, and they find that they have taken a wrong turn in their panic, and are now going against the sewer's current.

Eventually they come across a magically bored-out tunnel, and decide to enter, hoping the sewer beast following them is too large to enter the tunnel. Inside is an open reservoir filled with barrels and boxes. Branwyn sees a smear of blood leading to a crate, and opens it to find it is full of brains. She backs away, disgusted, and leaves Brewster to open the others. Brewster opens another crate and finds it is full of half-carved torsos, none of which appear to be human. He also opens one of the barrels, to find it is full of an unrecognizable, viscous, black bile. He notes some familiar traces of magic from within the liquid, but cannot identify it.

The pair decide to move some of the bile around a nearby corner in the sewers, hoping to lure the beast following them away from the tunnel and escape. While moving one of the crates, Branwyn notices blue etchings underneath it, and pushes it aside to reveal a summoning sigil. Brewster recognizes it as a necromancy summoning circle, and also picks up a dagger. Unknown to them, this dagger looks identical to the one Lexar used to summon the corpse-eaters in Montrissad. Brewster feels an intelligence in the knife, but is unable to recognize it fully. On the handle is a language which he is unable to read.

With the monster approaching, Brewster fills [[Puck Nash|Puck]] with guts from the crates, and has him dump them around the corner. Branwyn hides in the room, but Brewster can't resist, and peeks through the tunnel to see a tall, lanky, pale, disproportionate monster walk past. It seems it falls for the trap, and passes the tunnel. The pair leave the room and quickly escape back down the sewer, downstream.

However, some rations drop from Branwyn's pack as she runs away, falling into the river. Hearing this, the monster turns and begins running after them. They soon find another sewer grate, but are unable to open it before the monster approaches. Branwyn cuts her rope to be a shorter length, and casts Rope Trick to escape. Brewster is able to climb up into the extradimensional space, but Branwyn, tired from a day of being chased, doesn't have the strength to climb. The monster catches up, and slashes at Branwyn, who recognizes the monster as being reminiscent of a corpse eater. When slashed, Branwyn feels the burning of poison in her wound. She uses her boots to Misty Step to the top of the rope, and climbs into the space, Brewster pulling up the rope behind her. He gives Branwyn another healing potion.
## Lothric
Moiloc asks citizens if they have seen Violet. She hears that Violet has been sighted near the Goldstrauss Bank, and proceeds that way. She also hears rumors that a non-human has been murdering children in the area. While proceeding through the gold district, she looks for more Resistance sigils, but doesn't find any.

The bank itself is lavish. There is a bright blue crystal at the top, which Moiloc recognizes as a magic force field, preventing projectiles from entering, keeping magic from being performed inside, and other protective features. As she enters, Inquisitors guarding the entrance asks for her papers. She provides the visa, and the Inquisitors suggest she apply for citizenship while in the bank.

Inside the premises of the bank is a lavish fountain, flower gardens, magic brooms cleaning the grounds, and many people waiting in line for teller windows. In the back is a guarded staircase. Moiloc asks a bank worker what's upstairs, and he says if she needs to ask, he shouldn't answer. She also overhears someone get their loan rejected at a teller window, with the teller suggesting they go the [[The Goat]] for a loan. Moiloc questions him about the goat, asking where he is lending from, and he says she shouldn't approach him, and that she doesn't want to be indebted to him. He says he's going to Whitehall, since he can't afford Lothric's new tax policy.

Leaving the bank grounds, Moiloc sees the vault, which is a separate building on the premises. She searches around the bank and the surrounding area for Resistance sigils or anything else of note, but doesn't find anything. Getting hungry, she proceeds to the docks and buys some mythril fish, a specialty in the area.
## Sewers
After waiting for some time, the corpse flayer finally leaves, and Branwyn and Brewster are able to leave the extradimensional space. With more time on their hands, Branwyn is finally able to open the sewer grate. Looking outside, she finds they are in the neighborhood housing the Advisors to the [[Queen Cypha|queen]]. Not wanting to enter what is both one of the most guarded areas and the home to the most powerful people of the city, they decide to return to the sewers and find another exit.

Soon after re-entering the sewers, the wet slapping sound returns, this time both from in front of and behind the pair. Not wanting to test their luck the Advisors' neighborhood, they decide to quickly press forward and see if they can find a new exit.

They find themselves at a portcullis blocking their way forward, with a corpse flayer both close in front and behind them. There is a lever on the other side of the sewer which might open it.

> [!danger] Fight
> The corpse flayer in front of them immediately slashes at Branwyn, poisoning her. Brewster casts Sanctuary on Branwyn since she is so close to death, and sends Puck across the sewers to pull the lever. Both corpse flayers attack Brewster, who follows Branwyn across the sewer. One corpse eater crosses the river and attacks Brewster, but misses, and the other is unable to fully cross the sewer before Brewster and Branwyn pass the open portcullis. Once they both pass, Puck pulls the lever again, cutting him off from Brewster and Branwyn. Puck deactivates, turning back into a gem, and Brewster grabs it through the bars of the portcullis before the corpse flayers are able to catch up.
## Lothric
Kaldrake and Belnades go to the processing shack to get papers, which proves to be very easy once Kaldrake proves he is a Sootspot with his signet ring. They both are given free entry, and papers that say they are a guest of the Queen, and should be permitted entry to anywhere in the town.

Kaldrake proceeds straight to Gwyneth. Nobody seems to pay him any mind, even with his elven ears showing. Kaldrake also notices a shadowy figure following them, making appearances in nearby alleys, but is unable to get a good look at it. Once reaching the gates in front of the Advisor housing, Kaldrake asks for Gwyneth, and shows his papers. The guard tells him that Gwyneth is meeting with the Advisor of Coin, and points out both that house, and Gwyneth's. Kaldrake proceeds to Gwyneth's to wait for her. Kaldrake notes that the Advisors are the Advisor of Magics (Gwyneth), the Advisor of Coin, the Advisor of Strength, and the Advisor of Secrets.

As Kaldrake approaches the door, it seems to recognize him, and magically opens. Kaldrake and Belnades enter, and see an imp by the front door, who introduces himself as [[Bisco]]. He is wearing a magic collar embossed with blue runes. He seems to be magically bound here. He informs them that he lives in the manor, and that Gwyneth owns him, but seems to not be allowed to provide too much more information. He claims to be able to cast Fireball.

In the back of the entrance hall are green sigils, which seem to act as an elevator. Belnades follows Kaldrake up the tower, but they need to hold hands for it to work on her, which is a bit awkward. Kaldrake hopes to find Gwyneth's room, and finds it upon opening the first door. Wondering if the door is perhaps magical in nature, Kaldrake closes it, and tries to picture her parent's bedroom. This time, upon opening the door, she finds it is connected to the wardrobe in her parent's bedroom. However, she notes that unlike when she visited with Branwyn, the room is not in disrepair.

Kaldrake closes the door again, and enters Gwyneth's bedroom. She finds it's very similar to Gwyneth's castle in Montrissad, and is able to use the same key as before on a similar keyhole in the bedframe. However, this time a hatch appears below instead of above, and the hatch is also locked. Luckily, Kaldrake remembers finding a key in a hidden compartment in Gwyneth's desk in Montrissad, and the same compartment is in the desk in this room as well. Again, there is also a journal in it, although it seems to be encoded in half-Celestial, half-Sylvan, and Kaldrake is unable to make it out. He does note, however, that Gwyneth might have a little crush on the Advisor of Coin. Kaldrake uses the new key to open the hatch, which disappears and reveals a deep pit.

Kaldrake leaves, proceeding to a kitchen, where he finds wooden automata embossed with pink runes cooking. Kaldrake returns to Bisco to ask how to command them (he just has to say "I command you") and returns to have them make him tea and sandwiches. Kaldrake goes to a drawing room to await his sister.

Inside is a portrait of a young Martin the Great. Kaldrake again tries to convince Belnades of his now-incorrect memories, but Belnades insists most of what Kaldrake remembers did not actually happen. Kaldrake also notices an odd, dark-grey mole on Martin's portrait, which has never been there before. Kaldrake asks Belnades of the Hakon family, and Belnades confirms they are a group of drow known for their cruelty.

Meanwhile, Brewster and Branwyn finally are able to emerge from the sewers, through a grate in the Goldstrauss Bank. Branwyn uses Disguise Self, and Brewster wears the mask, as they sneak from the grate and proceed to the gold district to look for signs of the Resistance. They're finally able to find a sigil, but it's on a house which has been blasted in, reminiscent of the destruction of the houses in Montrissad during the corpse eaters' attacks.

They also finally meet back up with Moiloc, and they fill each other in. Moiloc checks in on the house, and finds half of a body, but doesn't enter since there are Inquisitors investigating the scene. Branwyn and Brewster need to return to the bathhouse, and while they're inside, Moiloc notices the figure in the alleys which had been following them again. She heads to the alley, and uses Command to make it introduce itself. It shows itself, being a shadowy spirit which cannot speak, although Moiloc senses it was sent by Shurima. Moiloc asks it to tell her where to go, as she returns to the others, now bathed. Soon after, an image appears in Moiloc's head of an abandoned and boarded-up noble's house.

The trio proceeds to this house, and enters through a window. Under an askew rug they find a hatch, and in the cellar they find one of the kegs is actually a secret entrance. They enter, finding it to be full of non-humans, and familiar faces from the Resistance. Gorm and his raiders are in the corner.
