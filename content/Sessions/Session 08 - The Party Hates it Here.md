### Logline
*Lexar and Kaldrake go through their initiation into the Inquisitors. Branwyn and Moiloc investigate the suspicious inner workings of Brasov after party members begin disappearing.*
### Synopsis
Gertrude has inexplicably disappeared. Moiloc and Branwyn begin fulfilling their contract with Arklow Laban, and find a suspicious clothing store while asking around town. Kaldrake successfully joins the Inquisitors, but Lexar's initiation goes wrong when he is plagued with terrible visions and wakes up in a spike pit with Jiren, a demon sent to serve him. Belnades and Kaldrake investigate a caravan which was recently ransacked by rebels against the church. Moiloc and Branwyn struggle with which companion to look for after leading a citizen to believe they may want to kill an Inquisitor and possibly being reported to the monastery. Kaldrake rescues Violet, a rebel taken prisoner by the church, and aides her in the assassination of the monastery head. Moiloc and Branwyn take a detour to Grima's Grove in an attempt to answer Branwyn's questions about the forest, and get a lead on tracking down Mora. Lexar returns to Brasov to find Goro and Belnades about to be burnt at the stake. Lexar rescues Goro, who rescues Belnades, and the three flee the city.
# Day 26
## Wavecrasher
[[Moiloc KodlaksdottÃ«r|Moiloc]] and [[Branwyn of Coryphea]] wake up in the ship's barracks. Moiloc teaches Branwyn how to use a whetstone as she sharpens her new weapon. The pair notice that [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]], [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], [[Gertrude Spugel|Gertrude]], and [[Pine]] are missing from the ship, but with no leads continue with their contract form the Adventurer's Guild. The contract tells of a monster haunting a nearby Chateau, a manor owned by current governor, [[Arklow Laban]], although due to the haunting nobody visits the Chateau anymore. Laban is currently staying at the Wandering Cross, a nearby inn, according to the contract. Moiloc and Branwyn leave the boat, thanking [[Goro Hattori|Goro]] for watching [[Charlotte]] on their way out. Charlotte gives a parting hug to Branwyn and Moiloc ruffles Charlotte's hair. They leave a sleeping [[Contigo]] on the boat, and Branwyn asks a nearby fisherman on the docks for directions to the Wandering Cross. He gives her directions, and mentions [[Monty MacMasters|Michael's]] Fine Threads, a high-end clothing store and tailor, which they will pass along the way.
## Wandering Cross
Moiloc and Branwyn make their way to the Wandering Cross. It's pretty quiet at this hour. A stout, red-haired, freckled woman is behind the counter, likely the innkeeper. Moiloc introduces herself, and the innkeeper does the same, introducing herself as [[Jessie Harkness]]. Moiloc asks where Laban is, and Jessie says he got rowdy the night before, and may still be sleeping off a hangover. She recommends the pair return at a later time in the evening when he's awake. Moiloc also asks for more details on the contract, but Jessie says it's been blown out of proportion, and that she doubts the contract is fully correct. She also expresses her disdain toward Laban. She says he was knighted and is the new governor, after the previous political power, the Brayden family, disappeared a few decades ago. Despite all this, she tells the pair the location of Laban's room, and asks if they need one as well. Branwyn declines, and until Laban is awake, the pair decide to check out Michael's Fine Threads.
## Michael's Fine Threads
Michael's is a one-room shop filled with very nice, almost royal-quality clothing. It's a bit out of place in the surrounding town. At the counter is a female tiefling with human-colored brown skin. She has dark auburn hair, under which her horns are noticeably filed down to be flat on her head. Her tail is wrapped around her like a belt. Moiloc and Branwyn talk with her, noting that she very cheerful. She mentions that the owner is a short elf, which is odd. Branwyn, thinking this matches Monty's MO, tells Moiloc to stay in the store as she checks around the back of the store for a possible other entrance, which she is unable to find. She reunites with Moiloc and the pair grab some seared eel, a Brasov specialty, from a street vendor, hoping to disguise themselves as room service when going to Laban's room at the inn.
## Monastery
[[Belnades]] wakes [[Kaldrake Sootspot|Kaldrake]], who notices that Belnades now sports an eyepatch over one eye. Belnades says [[Father Gregor]] wants to see Kaldrake, who makes his way to the head office. Upon entering he realizes it smells strongly of alcohol. The sun is coming in from the window behind Father Gregor, silhouetting him in a godly light. He prompts Kaldrake to kneel, saying the initiation is beginning. He does so, feeling a pleasant sensation come over him as he kneels. Father Gregor speaks in a tongue foreign to Kaldrake for some a moment before prompting Kaldrake to rise again. Father Gregor presents Kaldrake with a vial of blue powder, saying it is a gift from [[Eru]], and to breathe it in. This will be Kaldrake's trial, Gregor explains. Kaldrake inspects it for a moment, noting it's odorless, but definitely magical. He is unable to identify what it is, but inhales it. Kaldrake immediately feels wired as his muscles surge with strength. The tightening of his muscles cause pain to surge through his body. He finds himself wanting more, as he forms an addiction to ydril. The drug effectively gives Kaldrake resistance to magic for a day, after which it will need to be consumed again. Father Gregor welcomes Kaldrake as a mystic inquisitor, and presents him with a badge donning the eye of Eru. Gregor explains that Belnades will give him his first mission momentarily, and to return to the barracks.

Belnades shakes a tired [[Lexar Bellos|Lexar]] to wake him, but after the night of games, where [[Andre]], the quieter inquisitor in the barracks, won, Lexar does not want to get up. Eventually Lexar feigns falling off the bed and convinces Belnades it was her fault. Lexar also notices the eyepatch, and asks how her night was, which seems to anger Belnades. Kaldrake comes in soon after, and tells Lexar to just try what he is about to be offered in his initiation. Lexar responds that he'll try anything once, and Kaldrake immediately goes to vomit.

Lexar's initiation begins the same, up until he takes the ydril. He feels the same warmth and pain, but is unable to muster the pain and passes out. When he opens his eyes he witnesses a vision: he is bound, and so hot he is covered in sweat. He's in a cell made of a dark metal. The sound of chains rattling resonates through the cell. He feels a sense of dread and fear but is unable to place why. The door is opened and he is able to notice a torture rack. He screams, as the vision ends.

Lexar wakes up at the bottom of a pit of spikes, and comes to the conclusion that he had been thrown in while he was unconscious but missed the spikes themselves. The pit is filled with bones, some of which seem to come from children. Lexar feels a weight on his back, which falls of as he stands. Lexar looks to the item to see it's a [[Jiren|quazit]] writhing on the ground after falling. The quazit introduces himself as the ancient demon Jiren, and says he has been sent by [[Olidamuru]] to assist Lexar. He also informs Lexar that he is the chosen one before turning into a toad and hopping into his pocket. Lexar uses Spider Climb to crawl out of the pit and finds himself in a forest clearing late at night. Looking back, he sees the pit it no longer visible. Nearby in the forest Lexar notices an apple tree and is enticed by it, but resists. He figures it is likely a trap to lure passersby into the pit. Lexar climbs a nearby tree and sees a road with a pillar of smoke nearby. Staying off the road slightly to refrain from being noticed by possible inquisitors, Lexar begins to follow the road back to town.

Meanwhile, back at the monastery, Kaldrake pushes Belnades for more information on her missing eye. He brings up that last night Belnades said she would be fine if they left her alone with Father Gregor, asking why she didn't say anything. Belnades dodges the question, and mentions that they discussed some nearby rebels who the church believes is trying to steal ydril. After some time passes, Kaldrake asks where Lexar is, to which Belnades responds that she's sure everything is alright. After another few minutes, Father Gregor enters with a letter for Belnades, and whispers something to her before departing. Belnades hands the letter to Kaldrake, saying it is his first mission, and that Lexar parted with them amicably due to his own religious affiliations, which Kaldrake believes. The letter is in a yellow envelope with the eye of Eru imprinted on it, and smells of mothballs. Inside is a contract asking to find the rebels who are acting against the church and bring them back to the monastery for punishment. Belnades says she will come as well, as it is Kaldrake's first mission.

Belnades mentions that recently a caravan was raided, and they believe it to be the work of the rebels. They have captured their leader, who is being kept in the cells of the dungeon below the monastery. She goes on to say the rebels are a group of undesirable non-humans, such as monsters, orcs, and others. She leaves is up to Kaldrake as to whether they question the prisoner or go investigate the site of the raided caravan, and Kaldrake decides it would be best to gather information from the site before questioning the prisoner. Belnades mentions that Kaldrake can invite any friends to join then, but he says none of them would want to.
## Brasov Streets
On their way back to the inn, Moiloc and Branwyn pass Kaldrake and Belnades. Kaldrake mentions to the others that he has joined the inquisitors, which worries Moiloc and Branwyn. Moiloc distracts Belnades with questions about their own contract while Branwyn questions Kaldrake. Kaldrake tells Branwyn to be cool about the situation, disregarding her worries. Branwyn asks, elf-to-(half)-elf, if everything is okay and if he's safe, and Kaldrake insists everything is okay, and that he's not racist. Branwyn still pushes, but Kaldrake points out the advantages of the situation, namely the magic resistance. Branwyn asks at what cost this decision comes, and Kaldrake answers honestly: sobriety. Branwyn continues to ask about Lexar, and Kaldrake says he isn't sure where he is, but that he just left him in the monastery. He reiterates to stay cool about the situation, and that he just joined to check the situation out.

Belnades does have some information on Moiloc's contract. She mentions that there was no governor for forty years before Laban, who is a friend of the church. The old government just disappeared one day, then the church took over in the absence of an official ruler. The current governor was a war hero who destroyed many orc ships and took many of them as slaves. With both Branwyn and Moiloc having obtained the information they were after, the pair depart from the inquisitors.
## Wandering Cross
Moiloc and Branwyn return to the inn and proceed to the door to Laban's room. There is no answer after knocking loudly, so the pair decide to camp outside the door to his room, hoping to catch him when he comes out. Some time passes, and the two return to the lobby of the inn. They notice [[Terren Hammerfist|Terren]] whispering to the innkeeper, Jesse, but are unable to hear their conversation. Branwyn pulls Terren aside to ask about what he was discussing with Jessie, and to ask about Laban. Terren says he was talking with her about an inquisitor caravan, and mentions that they are having a meeting with someone named Violet in the inn basement that night. Realizing they likely won't be able to get to Laban anytime soon, Moiloc and Branwyn eat the eel they were hoping to give him, before it gets cold. Moiloc asks Jessie for a real breakfast, and Branwyn asks for ale. The pair discuss the situation with Kaldrake as well, realizing they can't make her leave or help her without making enemies of the inquisitors.

The pair now have to decide whether to find Monty, find Lexar, meet with Terren, rescue Kaldrake, or continue fulfilling the contract they took on. Branwyn asks Jessie for the location of the Chateau mentioned in the contact, and she says it's a run-down building, giving directions on how to get there. Moiloc suggests they could fake Kaldrake's death, and that she could pretend to kill him. Branwyn notices some fisherman leave as Moiloc says this. Worrying they may have overheard Moiloc's plan to effectively kill an inquisitor, Branwyn tells Moiloc to stay put and follows the fishermen out of the inn. One returns to the market, but Branwyn sees the other go toward the monastery. Branwyn tries to grab him, but he slips away and begins running away in fear. Branwyn swings her axe at him a few times in pursuit but is unable to reach him. Branwyn returns to the inn in a panic, grabs Moiloc, throws two gold pieces on the bar, and the pair run to the forest. Since they may now be considered rebels against the church, the pair decide to head in the direction Kaldrake and Belnades were going to meet back up with them.
## Raided Caravan Site
On their way to the site, Belnades informs Kaldrake on more of the church's practices. Kaldrake notices that Belnades, now with her helmet removed, has her tiefling horns filed down. Kaldrake decides not to bring it up. As they approach the caravan, Belnades summarizes the event once more for Kaldrake: the caravan was transporting ydril to Brasov was destroyed by the rebels.

They arrive to a burnt caravan, and three corpses. One was smoldering, and the other two seem to have died of electrocution. The wagon was burnt to the side of the road, although it's unclear if that was to hide the wreckage or because the wagon went offroad for some reason before the attack. Kaldrake finds tracks out into the woods, and serrated wounds on the electrocuted corpses. The wounds lead him to believe they were shot by a bow, then electrocuted after, but the only captured prisoner was a mage, implying there are likely more rebels who got away, although he doesn't voice this possibility to Belnades. All this combined leads Kaldrake to believe the wagon was looted, and the lack of destroyed goods may mean the goal was to take the ydril and not simply destroy it.

Kaldrake asks about the prisoner, and Belnades mentions that so far she has been resistant to their usual methods of torture. Belnades also mentions the prisoner is a "dirty tiefling." Kaldrake mentions she doesn't think all tieflings are bad, but Belnades responds saying it's simply in their nature.

Belnades goes on to explain the beliefs and history of the church. The rebels are made up of the "non-humans" which the church deems monstrous. Non-humans are not allowed to own land in the areas ruled by the inquisitors. The church is led by [[Pontiff Sulyvahn]], who suggests and passes these regulations and holds gubernatorial power in addition to religious power in locations where the religion is prominently practiced. Recently, there has been more rebel behavior, so while Belnades was abroad in Montrissad, there was a purge where many non-humans were either executed or exiled to what Belnades describes as the "dung of the mountains."

With this, Kaldrake decides he can't get anything else from the site. He and Belnades begin preparations to return to the monastery, and Kaldrake finally breaks and asks Belnades about her horns, mentioning that she is clearly not human. Belnades explains that she is only half tiefling, and was born out of wedlock. She is rebelling against her internal hellish ways, and believes Eru will welcome her into heaven if she continues with the inquisitors. Kaldrake mentions that racism is bad and she doesn't think Belnades should think like that, and questions how this aligns with Eru's teachings if Eru was the Creator of all races. Belnades corrects him, saying Eru only made humans. The other races were made by the heinous Great Old Ones.

Moiloc and Branwyn finally are able to reunite with the Kaldrake. While they are making their way to where they believed Kaldrake to have gone, Branwyn began to feel a strange familiarity with the forest, becoming a bit emotional. However, she also notices that many of the trees are ecologically out of place. When they get to Kaldrake, Moiloc asks him if he thinks Brazov is safe yet, and Belnades overhears, questioning why it wouldn't be. Moiloc begins to feign tears, mentioning that crowds like she saw in Brazov upset her and make her think of Montrissad and what happened there. Belnades seems to believe this, and mentions the rebels shouldn't be a threat and they should be fine. Moiloc sees the corpses on the caravan and points them out, using it as proof that Brazov may not be as safe as Belnades lets on. Branwyn steps in to ask Belnades a few more questions about the contract, as it would be far enough away she would feel safe continuing with the mission. Rather than directing them to the Chateau, he points out a location they will find along the way, [[Grima|Grima's]] Grove. Jessie had mentioned this location as somewhere not to enter when she was giving the pair directions originally. Belnades mentions a druid who takes residence there, Grima, who they may want to speak with. The group split and head to their respective destinations.
## Monastery
Belnades leads Kaldrake to the dungeon under the monastery. She gives him the keys, and says she is going back to the barracks. She thinks it may be best if Kaldrake questions the prisoner on his own, as nothing the inquisitors have tried has worked. Kaldrake descends into the dungeon, to see five cells on each side of the hall. He proceeds to the one Belnades told him the prisoner was in, and sees a dirt-covered [[Violet|tiefling]] wearing tattered rags, chained to the wall. Kaldrake makes a point to visibly leave her weapons at the cell door, and approaches. The tiefling has purple skin, with bendy goat horns, and a gash across her face which seems to be fresh. One of her eyes is green, and the other is pink. She is clearly angry, and after Kaldrake introduces himself, she spits in her direction.

Kaldrake explains that he is a new recruit, and the prisoner says he is a traitor to his Elven people. Kaldrake suggests that they pretend he is interrogating her to buy some time, which seems to give the prisoner a reluctant sense of trust, as she goes along with it. Kaldrake mentions that they're in a bit of a bad spot, and the prisoner responds by saying they'll always be in a bad spot until the church is taken down. The prisoner tells Kaldrake some information about the rebels as a group that acts against the church, pitching that he join, but the prisoner stops talking after she almost gives away some information she wouldn't like the inquisitors to know. Kaldrake asks about a meeting spot, but the prisoner refuses to give away that info until he proves himself. Kaldrake shakily opens the shackles and frees the prisoner, giving her a minor healing potion. The prisoner introduces herself as Violet.

Kaldrake checks if the coast is clear as the two ascend the stairs leading out of the dungeon. Kaldrake walks Violet through the best route of escape, and Violet perks up when she hears they will be passing Father Gregor's door. She tells Kaldrake to help her and take the chance to kill Gregor. Kaldrake is initially hesitant to this idea and how much it will actually hurt the Inquisitors in the grand scheme of things. Violet swears she will be able to do it, saying she doesn't use normal magic, more of a psychic ability that she is sure can take him down. She presses Kaldrake, telling him to be a hero, and Kaldrake, through tears, says he'll do it - he'll be a hero. Violet asks Kaldrake to distract Gregor while she gets into position. Kaldrake asks how long she'll need, and she says it'll only be about thirty seconds. Violet places her hand on her chest, and becomes invisible.

Kaldrake knocks on the door, and Gregor asks what he wants. He states he wants to tell him of what he found out on his mission, but also to ask about Lexar. As Kaldrake enters, he feels Violet slip in past him. Gregor asks for a report, and Kaldrake tells him that he believes others may have run off, but quickly diverts to asking about Lexar before Violet can act. Gregor says he and Lexar simply had theological differences, and that Lexar left to spread his own heathen religion somewhere else. Kaldrake jokes that he won't do well. He then hears a voice in his head - Voilet's - mentioning that Gregor is too hard to reach behind the desk. Kaldrake presses further, saying leaving like that is very unlike Lexar. Gregor responds to trust in Eru and stop asking questions about it. Kaldrake begins to speak up again, but Gregor continues, saying to stop asking, lest he suffer Eru's wrath. Kaldrake responds, asking if that's what happened to Belnades, a bit accusatorily, and Gregor moves to respond, as his throat is slit. Kaldrake, being squeamish, throws up immediately, and Violet continues by bashing an already-dead Gregor's head in with a book on his desk, filled with rage, not listening to Kaldrake's pleas for her to stop. Kaldrake turns away, but can still hear what's happening. He takes the time to shakily respond to his fantasy mom's fantasy text on his fantasy phone, asking if he had a girlfriend yet - or boyfriend, she won't judge. Violet raises her hand and the glass window that sat behind Gregor shatters. Violet motions for Kaldrake to follow, saying it leads to the outer wall, but they'll need to be stealthy, and will likely need use the nearby bay to swim around the wall and escape the city.
## Grima's Grove
Branwyn and Moiloc finally reach the main road after cutting through the forest, per Belnades's direction. After following it for a moment, they come across Grima's Grove, which simply appears to be a part of the forest sectioned off for a natural preserve or orchard. Branwyn, still curious about the forest itself, enters the Grove, and Moiloc follows. While walking through, Branwyn forages some spring onions from the surrounding forest. After some time walking through the Grove, Branwyn notices the terrain is looping as she recognizes the greenery. Branwyn attempts to announce to Grima that they mean him no harm, to no response. Branwyn picks up a stick and marks a nearby tree, hoping to recognize it on the next loop, but on the next loop it is gone. Branwyn deduces by this that it isn't a true loop, and begins to question a way out, as Moiloc notices a strange essence coming from a nearby tree. She tells Branwyn about it, and as Branwyn touches the tree, it begins to hum. Moiloc does the same, but nothing happens, as if the tree is waiting for something. While touching the tree, Moiloc introduces herself, saying she means her no harm. She also introduces herself as the princess of the Kodlak Islands. After finished, as if a mirage was lifted, a hut appears, as does a pond and many flamingos. The hut seems to be inhabited, and a fire is going inside.

Moiloc knocks, but it seems Grima is not inside. Branwyn notices the terrain is man-made, almost terraformed, and looks around, to see a blue jay aarakocra. Once she notices him, he invokes the ancient right of hospitality, gifts in exchange for time. He poofs away, re-appearing behind Branwyn, rummaging through her sack. Seeing her panther pelt, he mentions that she should not have killed an endangered panther, referring to her as a "vessel of Mora." Branwyn mentions that these woods seem a lot like her home woods, and Grima responds that most druidic woods would, as they are all Forests of the World, formed by the god [[Maokai]].

He continues, explaining Maokai to Moiloc. Maokai is often known as The Walking Forest. He is a treant and the God of druids and rangers. He created the forests and hold dominion over them. He used to live in Phaeros, but was defeated in the burning of Grovewatch. The burning and Maokai's current whereabouts are still shrouded in mystery. Mora wanted to find him. She was a wild card so he can't speak to her motives, but he would guess she wanted to steal his power. Grima interjects his story to say he wouldn't approve of that, if it were the case. As a warning, he tells Branwyn to stay away from her, or she'll take all which she holds dear. Branwyn has questions, but Grima directs her to Dunn, a settlement nearby in the mountains. According to his flamingos, that's where the last known sighting of Mora occurred.

Branwyn thanks him and asks what she can do for him in return. He voices his curiosities about Moiloc, who he noticed is a follower of Shurima. He asks to know everything. Moiloc tells him of the fish people attacking the Kodlak Islands, which seems to satisfy Grima's curiosities. Branwyn asks how she can protect the forest, and Grima tells her to stay in Wallachia and seek out the rebels. She tells them the rebels affiliate with Jessie from the inn. He says the [[Queen Cypha|queen]] must die to protect the forest. He vows to help when he can, but his flamingos need him, so he will stay in the Grove. He tells Branwyn to shed her cynical self. After his requests, he invites them to stay overnight, and provides them with flamingo-feather-stuffed beds. Moiloc learns that night that she is allergic to flamingos.

Outside the grove, Kaldrake and Violet are following the same path to get to Dunn. Violet notices some torches in the distance, and quickly hides in a bush. Kaldrake joins, and as the torches pass, the pair see inquisitors marching toward Brasov, fully armed. Kaldrake nervously tells Violet, and himself, to just be cool. Once they pass, Violet continues their trek toward Dunn, saying it's a friendly safe haven for humans.
## Brasov Outer Walls
Lexar, almost arriving at Brasov, sees the same inquisitors Kaldrake had just seen, and follow them from a distance as they head to Brasov. Lexar hears shouting and sees smoke from the market square in Brasov. Jiren telepathically speaks to Lexar telling him to put his hood up before entering the city, and he does so. As Lexar approaches the square, he sees a burning stake, with a halfling tied to it, burning to death. There is a line leading up to the pyre of four prisoners, among which Lexar recognizes Belnades and Goro. There are two inquisitors guarding the prisoners, somewhat distracted by the burning halfling, and three keeping guard over the pyre. Two more inquisitors are keeping back a crowd of onlookers.

Lexar sneaks behind some buildings to get close enough to speak to Goro telepathically. He informs him of his plan, telling him to run as soon as Lexar gives him the go-ahead. Lexar has Jiren turn invisible, and has him go over to Goro and untie him. Lexar attempts to use Dissonant Whispers on the guard by Goro but fails, drawing the guard's attention. While the nearby guard is distracted Goro begins untying Belnades, against Lexar's instructions.

> [!danger] Fight
> Lexar uses Eldritch Blast on the pursuing guard, who crumples to the ground, as the other inquisitor guarding the line of prisoners also begins his pursuit. Goro and Belnades use one alleyway to escape as Lexar leads the surviving inquisitor down another alleyway. The inquisitor throws his spear to Lexar but misses, as Lexar un-summons and re-summons Jiren to get him by his side, filling the inquisitor with fear. Lexar uses Eldritch Blast and Jiren uses his claws, twice each, as the guard continues to miss out of fear. Lexar's third Eldritch Blast decapitates the guard, and he and Jiren leave to find their companions.

Lexar reunites with Goro and Belnades, seeing them attempt to climb the wall and escape. Goro fills Lexar on the whereabouts of the others as Lexar has Jiren turn into a bat to lug a rope over the wall and make it easier to climb. Contigo was seen in the crowd of onlookers watching the pyre. Goro left Charlotte with Jessie. Skalazar is bringing the ship north toward a safer shore where they can meet him, although Goro isn't sure Skalazar would be able to judge the distance Goro gave him correctly, so the three quickly begin to make their way along the northward shores after they scale the wall. Lexar mentions to Goro that saving Belnades was not part of the plan, and mentions Belnades likely had part in what Lexar believes to be his attempted murder. Goro says he saved her because he didn't want to leave anyone behind, but the pair remain cautious of her. The trio continue north toward the agreed meeting point for the ship.
